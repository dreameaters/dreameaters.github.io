### Coming Soon...

Here you should be able to find everything you need to know to accomplish the most common tasks when blogging with Hydejack.
Should you think something is missing, [please let me know](mailto:mail@qwtel.com).
Should you discover a mistake in the docs (or a bug in general) feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/hydecorp/hydejack/issues) on GitHub.

These guides are written in regards to Raid battles and Gym battles, not PvP (Go Battle League, battling other Trainers). Many different factors come into play during PvP which can drastically change a Pokemon, moveset, or strategy's viability compared to Raid/Gym battles. If you're interested in PvP focused information, check out our PvP section [here](/go/pvp/).
