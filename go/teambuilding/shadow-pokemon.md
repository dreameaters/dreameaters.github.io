# Shadow Pokemon

This article serves to give an analysis and breakdown of the various top performing Pokemon in terms of battling Raid Bosses. The main aspect important in an attacker is high `*[DPS]: Damage Per Second` (Damage Per Second), meaning that bulkier Pokemon with high Defense or HP won't be as useful. Pokemon with simply high Attack, and powerful moves, will prevail here. Also, it's a high priority for attackers to exclusively use moves matching one of their Types, like a Fire-type Pokemon using a Fire-type move, as it would gain STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), making the move 25% more powerful. Finally, having a moveset where both moves are the same Type is commonly called a "Double-[type]" moveset, and is almost always ideal.

> This guide expects an understanding of the terms "[Elite Move](/go/glossary/#elite-move)", "[STAB](/go/glossary/#stab-same-type-attack-bonus)", and "[`*[DPS]: Damage Per Second`](/go/glossary/#`*[DPS]: Damage Per Second`-damage-per-second)". Visit the [Glossary](/go/glossary/) if you encounter any terms you're unfamiliar with.

# Major Types

These are the Types that you'll get the most use out of, simply due to the fact that lots of 5✰ and Mega Raid Bosses are weak to them. You'll no doubt want a full Party of six for each of these Types, eventually hosting the most powerful of each category.

## Dark-Type

**Dark-type** Pokemon will be your best friends against **Psychic-types** like Mewtwo, Latios, Lugia, Cresselia, and more. Dealing Super-Effective damage while also boasting a 2x Resistance to Psychic-type moves, Dark-type Pokemon will hit hard, and survive very well at the same time.\
They'll also help you deal with **Ghost-types** well enough, hitting for weakness again, while taking neutral damage in return.

### Weavile & Honchkrow - Dark Sinnoh Evolutions
![Weavile](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/weavile.png)![Honchkrow](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/honchkrow.png)

> Snarl + Foul Play
{:.note title="Weavile Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Snarl + Sky Attack
{:.note title="Honchkrow Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Weavile and Honchkrow perform very similarly when Honchkrow uses **Dark Pulse** instead of **Sky Attack**, so I'm covering them together. When Honchkrow uses the optimal **Sky Attack** rather than going with a **Double-Dark Moveset** to match Weavile, it's much like Darkrai instead.\
Weavile evolves from Sneasel, and Honchkrow from Murkrow. Both require 100 Candy and a Sinnoh Stone to evolve. These Pokemon are both regularly uncommon, with Sneasel showing up more easily during Snowy weather. It will take some time, but should be a pretty consistent grind to get either of these two, and they're always worth catching. (Though Murkrow has a pretty annoying catch rate. Razz Berries recommended.)

> Noting that Honchkrow uses **Sky Attack** as its Charge Move, it can learn **Dark Pulse** instead at the cost of 16.7% `*[DPS]: Damage Per Second` (damage per second) in exchange for a **Double-Dark Moveset**. This makes it on par with Weavile, rather than Darkrai.
{:.note title="Note: Double-Dark Honchkrow"}

### Houndoom - Hell Hound
![Houndoom](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/houndoom.png)

> Snarl + Foul Play
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Houndoom can be easy to get if you find many Fire-types in the wild near you, or if its Mega Evolution is currently in Raids. Houndour can also be rescued from Team Go Rocket Grunts. However you get it, Houndoom is a great Dark-type to have, especially early on, and the potential to Mega Evolve it is a great bonus.

### Tyranitar - The Old King
![Tyranitar](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/tyranitar.png)

> Bite + Crunch
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The greatest Dark-type attacker back in the day, Tyranitar is still a force to be reckoned with today. If you have some from back in its glory days, they're as good as they ever were, it's just that now some newer Pokemon have surpassed them. If you don't have any yet, they're still a great Pokemon to train up. Catch it when it comes to 3✰ Raids, evolve a Shadow/Purified Larvitar, or stock up on wild catches when they're part of an event. With a Mega Evolution releasing later on, Tyranitar is sure to be sticking around.

> Shadow Tyranitar is an absolute beast, and though I'm not detailing Shadow Pokemon in this article, check out [Shadow Pokemon](/go/teambuilding/shadow-pokemon/) if you want to learn more. (Recommended Lv35+)
{:.note title="To purify or not..."}


## Dragon-Type

Super-effective against their own kind, **Dragon-types** are a bit of a double-edged sword, but they also happen to be some of the strongest Pokemon in existence. Though they faint quickly to each other, they're also the quickest at taking each other down. You're bound to amass a great collection of powerful Dragons eventually, and until then, **Ice-types** will help you wear them down to capture for yourself.

### Salamence & Dragonite - Rayquaza's Grunts
![Salamence](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/salamence.png)![Dragonite](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/dragonite.png)

> Dragon Tail + Outrage*
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Dragon Tail + Draco Meteor*
{:.note title="B-Tier Moveset"}
{:.faded}

These two are very similar, sharing the Dragon/Flying-typing as well as having the exact same best, and second best, movesets. They also share their types and moves with the great Rayquaza. Salamence has a little more Attack and a little less Defense, while Dragonite is the opposite. We know that offense is preferred, so generally Salamence is the better option, but they're both so close that it doesn't make much of a difference. Speaking of not much difference, their B-Tier Moveset is nearly as good as their Optimal Moveset (~2.5% `*[DPS]: Damage Per Second` difference).\
Additionally, Salamence will get a Mega Evolution at some point in the future, while Dragonite will not.

> *Dragonite has **Outrage** as a normal move, learnable by regular Charge TM, while **Draco Meteor** is an Elite Move learnable only during certain events or via Elite Charge TM. The opposite is true for Salamence.
{:.note title="Important! Elite Moves"}


## Rock-Type

Rock and roll! **Rock-type** Pokemon lead the pack in defeating both **Flying-type** and **Fire-type** Pokemon. If you're lacking in other types, they can also take down most **Ice-types** well enough. Plus, if you have any **Bug-types** to squish, rather than burn, then **Rock-type** Pokemon will server you well.

### Rampardos - Extinct for a reason.
![Rampardos](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/rampardos.png)

> Smack Down + Rock Slide
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

No other Rock-type attacker comes close to the raw power of Rampardos. However, offense is all it has. This ancient beast can hardly take a hit, and trades away the Rock-type's signature high defense in exchange for absolute crushing power. Rarely found in the wild (as Cranidos), it's worth Powering-Up for the massive hits it will deal before quickly falling itself, and should lead any Rock-type Raid Party for quick damage right at the start of the fight.


## Fire-Type

The searing flames of **Fire-type** Pokemon should be your first pick for dealing with **Grass**, **Ice**, or **Steel-type** Pokemon. With *many* powerful Pokemon in this Type, every Trainer is sure to have a good roster of **Fire-types** ready to blaze through the competition.

### Reshiram - Lord of Fire
![Reshiram](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/reshiram.png)

> Fire Fang + Overheat
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Reshiram is the ultimate Fire-type attacker. Only caught in 5✰ Raids, the vast white Dragon of truth will dominate any Grass, Ice, Bug, or Steel-types that you throw it at. Though it also fares well with a [**Double-Dragon Moveset**](#zekrom--reshiram---far-from-home), the Fire-type is where it truly is without match.


## Fighting-Type

The big bruisers of the Pokemon world! **Fighting-type** Pokemon live up to their name, boasting incredible Attack power. There's no better choice for breaking apart **Rock-types**, and are *required* for facing off against **Dark-types**. Also, if you ever need to, they're the only Type that's Super-Effective against **Normal-type** Pokemon.

### Machamp - The OG MVP
![Machamp](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/machamp.png)

> Counter + Dynamic Punch
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Counter + Close Combat
{:.note title="B-Tier Moveset"}
{:.faded}

A Pokemon that new Trainers used to work hard for, excited to break into the Raid scene. Machamp used to require either a strong party of Psychic-types to fight in 4✰ Raids (when those existed), or 125 Candy from (hopefully Weather Boosted) wild Machop spawns (which are often around). Nowadays, this true champion is *much* easier to get, and just as highly regarded as ever.

* Catch a high-level wild Machop (ideally in Cloudy Weather for the Weather-Boost to increase its Level even more).
* Trade your high-level Machop for a friend's.
* Evolve to Machoke using 25 Candy.
* Evolve for **free** (due to the trade) to Machamp.

That's all it takes. Trade Evolutions have made Machamp extremely easy to get, and if you don't have anyone to swap your high-level Machop with, it's just gonna mean adding 100 Candy to the formula instead. Not a huge deal, but it's best to have a trade friend if possible. Many experienced Trainers tend to hold on to a few high-level Machop for the sake of helping out newbies, so it doesn't hurt to ask around a bit.

Finally, in terms of Movesets, **Close Combat** does soften Machamp's impact noticeably, but as Machamp has 5 different Charge Moves, you could easily burn several Charge TMs trying to swap to **Dynamic Punch**. So if you're short on Charge TMs, sticking with **Close Combat** can be good enough until you have some extras to gamble with, but know that **Dynamic Punch** is definitely worth the upgrade.


## Psychic-Type

Proudly including the most powerful Pokemon of all time, Mewtwo, the **Psychic-type** has been considered extremely powerful since Pokemon first began. It still holds up well to that acclaim now, tearing through **Fighting-type** Pokemon, and **Poison-types**. Even in neutral matchups, Mewtwo itself can be a reliable party member.

### Mewtwo - The Most Powerful Pokemon
![Mewtwo](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/mewtwo.png)

> Confusion + Psystrike†
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Confusion + Psychic
{:.note title="B-Tier Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> "We dreamed of creating the world's most powerful Pokemon... And we succeeded."

Dr. Fuji, *Pokemon The First Movie*
{:.figcaption}

Dr. Fuji was right, before Mewtwo blew him up, along with the entire island and science lab he was created in. Since the beginning of Pokemon, Mewtwo has always been the most powerful. With the highest attack stat of any Pokemon in the game, along with its signature move, the Elite Charge Move **Psystrike†**, being the most powerful Psychic-type Move in the game, Mewtwo is truly unmatched. Even with **Psychic** (a Charge Move Mewtwo can always learn) in place of the Elite **Psystrike†**, Mewtwo is still the top of the Psychic-type by a landslide.

This is *the* Pokemon you'll always want to catch and train.

> Mewtwo's unmatched power really skews the Psychic-type list. Just know that the remaining Psychic-types listed all have higher `*[DPS]: Damage Per Second` than most top attackers of other Types. Mewtwo simply breaks the ceiling for what a #1 attacker is normally capable of.
{:.note title="Comparison Note"}


## Ice-Type

When you have no Dragons, you'll want plenty of **Ice-types**. Freezing **Dragon-type** Pokemon out of the sky, especially the ones that are also **Flying-type** (I'm looking at you, Rayquaza), these chill Pokemon will have a great place in your Raid Parties. Not to mention their use against **Ground-types**, and **Fire-types** if you lack their other counters.

### Mamoswine - Mammoth Bulk!
![Mamoswine](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/mamoswine.png)

> Powder Snow + Avalanche
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Costing a whopping 125 Candy and a Sinnoh Stone to fully evolve from Swinub, Mamoswine is a costly investment that tells you to Pinap any wild Swinub you find. Being Weather-Boosted by both Clear and Snow weather makes finding high-level ones easy though, which means you should have one or two good ones by the time you save up enough Candy to start evolving.

With a team composed of Mamoswines, and/or the following two Pokemon (Weavile and Glaceon), you'll be tearing into Dragon-types like a pro! Some of the strongest Pokemon will fall to your might!

### Weavile - The Sword of Ice
![Weavile](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/weavile.png)

> Ice Shard + Avalanche
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Evolving from Sneasel with 100 Candy and a Sinnoh Stone, Weavile is like Mamoswine without the bulk. Fainting faster, but nearly as powerful, Weavile trails *very* close behind the frigid mammoth. If Sneasel are more common than Swinub in your neck of the woods, then it's likely your best option when it comes to Ice-types.


## Electric-Type

Having only a single weakness in **Ground-types**, **Electric-type** Pokemon can be intimidating to battle against. Hitting Super-Effective damage against **Flying** and **Water-type** Pokemon means there are very common Pokemon that these shocking monsters can paralyze.

### Zekrom - Lord of Thunder
![Zekrom](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/zekrom.png)

> Charge Beam + Wild Charge
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Towering over its fellow Electric-types, the deep black dragon of ideals rules supreme. Only caught in 5✰ Raids, Zekrom is a Legendary worth chasing after. Though it also fares well with a [**Double-Dragon Moveset**](#zekrom--reshiram---far-from-home), the Electric-type is where it truly is truly shines.


## Ghost-Type

Much like Dragons, **Ghost-type** Pokemon are weak and strong against each other. Though **Dark-types** have nothing to fear from these ghouls, **Ghost-types** will hit **Psychic-types** even harder than their Dark rivals. It's a real risk for reward, and when Raiding, fainting faster is always worth it to KO the Raid Boss fast as well.

### Chandelure - Will-o-Wisp
![Chandelure](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/chandelure.png)

> Hex + Shadow Ball
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Though annoying, its certainly fitting that the best Ghost-type attacker in the game is a Pokemon almost exclusively seen around Halloween. Chandelure evolves from its base form, Litwick, which only spawns in the wild during Halloween events, or from its mid-stage, Lampent, which is a potential encounter in the Go Battle League (as of a certain rank).\
This spooky piece of haunted mansion decor is definitely worth the investment, and tops the Ghost-type by a large margin, alongside the unexpected 2nd best on this list. Keep scrolling.


## Ground-Type

As the *only* counter to **Electric-types**, **Ground-type** Pokemon are absolutely required in any Trainer's box. Dealing well with **Steel** and **Fire-types** means that these earthly beasts will have many chances to prove their worth to you.

### Landorus (Therian Forme) - The old ones warned about this...
![Landorus](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/landorus-therian.png)

> Mud Shot + Earth Power
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The superior forme of Landorus, this legendary kami is the king of defeating Electric-type Pokemon. A very recent release at the time of writing this (actually, it's still not out until next month), Therian Forme Landorus should be the ace of any Ground-type team. Hopefully soon, we'll have the option to change the lesser Incarnate Forme into this one, but an official announcement has yet to be made.

> If you're reading this and forme changing has been added to the game, please yell at me either on Twitter [@GoDreamEaters](https://www.twitter.com/godreameaters) or via e-mail at DreamEaters.Go@gmail.com
{:.note title="Updates Coming Soon"}
{:.faded}


## Steel-Type

Nothing fares better against **Ice-types** than **Steel-type** Pokemon. Should any **Fairy-type** Pokemon give you trouble, with their high Defense, then **Steel-types** are sure to cut them down to size, like a hero's sword.

### Metagross - Meteor Mash or Bust!
![Metagross](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/metagross.png)

> Bullet Punch + Meteor Mash†
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Let's get an unfortunate truth out of the way, right at the start.\
Without **Meteor Mash†**, Metagross can't help you as a Steel-type attacker.

**Meteor Mash†** makes Metagross the best Steel-type attacker by far. With the massive defense that Steel-types are known for, combined with the huge power of **Meteor Mash†**, Metagross is what any top attacker should hope to be. The only downside would be rarity. Beldum is a very rare wild spawn, but does show up in events from time to time. Grab it when you can, and hope for an event with **Meteor Mash†** in the future.

# B-Tier Types

These couple of Types both counter two of the same Types, and one unique Type each. In addition covering for eachother, which they both do so equally well, they both have three Types from the group above that simply do their jobs better most of the time. So, while these two Types are certainly nothing to stick your nose up to, you may eventually find yourself using them less often as you collect more powerful options.\
Listen to me though, this doesn't mean you should ignore them. They're largely accessible, and easier to train up than the Types we've covered already. They could be the quick start you've been looking for.

## Grass-Type

Outclassed by **Electric**, **Ice**, and **Fighting**, **Grass-type** Pokemon are built to counter **Water**, **Ground**, and **Rock-types**. They still work very well, but there's normally a better counter out there, if you can get one.

### Roserade - Beauty and Thorns!
![Roserade](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/roserade.png)

> Razor Leaf + Grass Knot
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The hardest-hitting Grass-type attacker, Roserade, will cost 100 Candy and a Sinnoh Stone to evolve from Roselia. No other Grass-type can tear through opponents like Roselia, making it an absolute superstar on any Grass-type Raid Party.


## Water-Type

Outclassed by **Ice**, **Ground**, and **Rock-types**, **Water-type** Pokemon can still hold their own and take down **Fire**, **Ground**, and **Rock-type** Pokemon.
Though **Water** and **Grass-types** share a couple purposes, they are on par with each other and will do their jobs well when needed.

### Kyogre - Leviathan (Stay Tuned!)
![Kyogre](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/kyogre.png)

> Waterfall + Surf
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The Pokemon said to have raised the tides in ancient times, Kyogre is a Legendary Pokemon that has yet to even show us its full potential, but is already an absolute beast. Nearly as devastating as the two Pokemon ranked below it on this list, but with *much* more bulk to back it up, Kyogre crashes through opponents like a tidal wave! With a Signature Move yet to be released (**Origin Pulse**), and a Mega Evolution also waiting for its time (Primal Kyogre), this leviathan is destined to become the undisputed best Water-type in the game, most likely holding that title forever.


---

# Outclassed

The Types listed here are almost never useful for Raiding, either due to terrible Attack stats, bad moves, or simply existing in the shadow of another Type that counters its targets better. Trainers generally ignore these Types when building Raid Parties, but as everyone has their favorite Types and may want to know how they can get the most out of them, I'm including them in this article mostly for the sake of completion. Be warned though that I will be ripping into them pretty hard, as I have almost nothing good to say about their capabilities as attackers. Several of them have better uses in [Go Battle League](/go/pvp/), but you'll have to read about that on another section of the site.

## Bug-Type

The **Bug-type** was simply never meant to be a big deal, as sad as that is to say plainly. They can counter big Types like **Dark** and **Psychic**, as well as **Grass**, but we've already discussed ways to deal with those, and **Bug-types** have *much* lower stats to work with. Fainting faster, and not hitting very hard, it's tough to find any reason to use them in Raids.

### Genesect - Metabee?
![Genesect](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/genesect.png)

> Fury Cutter + X-Scissor
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Genesect is as good as Bug-types get. Hosting the lowest `*[DPS]: Damage Per Second` of any Type's #1 slot, Genesect also holds the "honor" of being a Mythical Pokemon, locked behind a Special Research, 5✰ Raids, and being unable to be traded. So not only is the best Bug-type the worst #1, but it's also about as complicated as it gets to obtain. To top it all off, Genesect performs a bit better as a [Steel-type attacker](#genesect---death-metal-bug), while also being outclassed by 4 or 5 better Steel-types.\
If you want a big Bug-type, this is it. Though its runner-up is just barely below it, and much easier to catch. Keep scrolling.


## Fairy-Type

The things of storybooks and fables, **Fairy-type** Pokemon have a unique mystique to them, that unfortunately doesn't translate well into battle. Though they do counter **Dragon-types** better than anything else, with a 2x Resistance to the beasts, that's the part they were built for: Defense. **Fairies** will take a beating and keep standing, but at the cost of having very poor offense to work with. As I said at the very start of this article, we want fast power in high `*[DPS]: Damage Per Second`, even if it means fainting more. Surviving until the end doesn't help us if the timer runs out before the Raid Boss faints.

### Gardevoir - Pretty, I guess.
![Gardevoir](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/gardevoir.png)

> Charm + Dazzling Gleam
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Gardevoir is one of Kirlia's evolutions (base-form being Ralts), along with Gallade (which has no place here). This already means it's going to take a good while to collect enough candy to get evolved, being 125 from a rare wild spawn. Once you get there though, you have the second worst Type leader (only ahead of Genesect representing Bug-type). Gardevoir boasts solid Defense, and very lackluster Attack, making it horrible for attacking Raids. This is as good as Fairy-type gets though, so if you really want a hard-hitting Fairy, this is the closest you'll find.


## Flying-Type

Simply said, **Fire** and **Psychic-types** hit harder than **Flying-type** Pokemon tend to, and are less fragile. There are very few Raid Bosses that would be better countered by these birds, and only a single Legendary. (Virizion)

### Moltres - Sky Attack or Bust
![Moltres](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/moltres.png)

> Wing Attack + Sky Attack†
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The Elite Charge Move **Sky Attack†** pushes Moltres into the top slot when it comes to Flying-type attackers. It commonly has this Elite Move when caught from 5✰ Raids these days, but it's not a guarantee. Make sure to check the event details to find out if **Sky Attack†** is a part of the deal or not.\
Though with all of that said, Moltres is better off with a non-Elite [**Double-Fire Moveset**](#moltres---rising-phoenix).


## Poison-Type

With one of **Poison's** main targets being **Grass**, which often has **Poison** as its secondary Type, these toxic monsters are off to a bad start. Beyond the two Pokemon listed here, **Poison-types** have comparable stats to the lowly **Bugs** we covered higher up. The one thing they might be good for is breaking through **Fairy-type** Pokemon's high Defense, but **Steel-types** are still better suited for the job.

### Roserade - Why so Toxic?
![Roserade](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/roserade.png)

> Poison Jab + Sludge Bomb
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The only **Double-Poison Moveset** worth talking about here.


## Normal-Type

The most unfortunate Type when it comes to attacking, the **Normal-type** isn't Super-Effective against any Type at all. Though they can often learn a wide variety of Typed moves, they won't get STAB on any of them, making them 25% weaker all the time when compared to properly Typed counters.\
Though I'm personally a fan of many **Normal-type** Pokemon, I'll be discussing none here, because they won't do you any good at all in Raid Battles.
