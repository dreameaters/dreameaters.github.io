# Why Some Types Are Bad

Right away, let me say that title is a lie. It's just the easiest way to sum up the point I'm going to explain, which more accurately is that some types you'll have very little (or even no) use for when it comes to building Raid teams of attackers. This normally comes down to said types being outclassed by others in terms of countering specific types of Raid bosses. (And yes, the word "type" is going to be said a *lot* here. I'll try to write things in ways that are easy to keep track of and follow.)

## B-Tier Types - Outclassed, but still good.

### Grass
Important, with Water and Ice, for Ground-types like Groudon. Can pair with Water and Ground against Rock.
### Water
Important, with Grass and Ice, for Ground-types like Groudon. Can pair with Rock against Fire.

## Bogged Down by Bulk - Defense is not the best Offense.

### Bug - Caterpie & Friends Can't Hack It!
Never meant to be big bois.
### Fairy
Defensive af, leaves nothing left for offense.
### Flying - Getting Burnt by Mindgames
Fire and Psychic do its jobs better.
### Poison - It'd rather use a sword.
Grass/Poison is very common, and Steel beats Fairy better. (Still worth something against it?)
