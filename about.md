# About

My name is **Mato**, and I'm the webmaster of this site, and head of **Team Dream Eaters**.\
I created this site with the intention of making guides to help players get deeper into **Pokemon Go**, as a sort of intermediary between casual play and more hardcore mindsets, strategies, and skill sets.

As there already exists *many* sites with comprehensive and deep guides regarding the more hardcore aspects of **Pokemon Go**, I've found many people struggle to wade into the more complex facets of the game, and seeking a starting point to broaden their understanding of its mechanics in order to develop better strategies and build stronger teams of **Pokemon**. That's what this site strives to be.

By breaking down and explaining various terminology and mechanics, while also being careful to explain not just what's good but *why* something is good, the guides and articles I write on this site are made with the goal of leaving players with the methods and understanding they need to come to their own answers to questions they will often ask.

"What moves matter on this Pokemon?"\
"Should I use X or Y in this party? They both seem good,"\
"How much will Powering Up a few more times matter in the next Raid?"

I want players to feel confident as Trainers, being able to make informed decisions about the way they raise their Pokemon, build their teams, and play the game as a whole, to be able to enjoy everything that **Pokemon Go** has to offer, with as little stress or confusion as possible.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or requests for things you'd like to see added or changed on the site, or you see something on the site that doesn't work, or is no longer accurate, please email me at **DreamEaters.Go@gmail.com**.
