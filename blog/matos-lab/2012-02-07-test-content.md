The new evolutions in gen 4, Tangrowth, Weavile, Mamoswine, Electivire, etc, weren't in the Sinnoh Dex in Diamond and Pearl. They were like, extra.

> Wow, okay, I get it. It's dumb, but I get it.

Only in Platinum were they added as a little expansion at the end of the Pokedex, and then we're made obtainable in-game.

That itself, making new Pok√©mon and not having them in the Pokedex, is a really weird and rediculous idea, but at least it's not as crazy as making the Dex impossible to complete.
