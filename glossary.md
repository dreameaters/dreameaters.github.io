# Glossary of Terms

* ToC dummy text
{:toc}


### Bulk
A non-descript term for a Pokemon having high defense and/or HP. (Generally, or relatively.)

### CP (Combat Power)
text\
CP = (Attack * Defense^0.5 * Stamina^0.5 * Total_CP_Multiplier ^ 2) / 10

### DPS (Damage Per Second)
A number used to note how much damage a specific Pokemon can mathematically deal on average.\
More generally, it's commonly used as the measure to compare the offensive power of Pokemon, across different Movesets, levels, species, etc.\
Often considered a more useful metric than [TDO](#tdo-total-damage-output), due to being based entirely on a specific Pokemon, without regard to a specific opponent.

### Elite Move
Some Pokemon have moves that they can't normally learn, but are able to get under special conditions. These moves are most often available during a Community Day staring said Pokemon, which is guaranteed to learn the Elite Move upon full evolution during the Commnity Day hours.\
(Other reasons for a Move being Elite are mostly very obscure, and aren't worth being detailed here.)\
The only way for a Pokemon to learn an Elite Move outside of the appropriate event, is through the use of either an Elite Fast TM or an Elite Charge TM, depending on the kind of Move in question. These items are *very* limited, and are detailed further in [Rare Items](/go/trainer-school/rare-items){:.heading.flip-title}.

> Throughout this site, and in most other fan-made Pokemon Go documentation, Elite Moves are denoted by **†**.\
> Example: The Moveset of **Fire Spin** + **Blast Burn†** / **Dragon Claw** for Charizard shows that "Blast Burn" is an Elite Charge Move for Charizard.

### Power
1. A "slang" term for a Pokemon's [DPS](#dps-damage-per-second). ie, a powerful Pokemon is normally one with high DPS.
2. A lazy way to say [Combat Power](#cp-combat-power) (aka CP). Often avoided, to not confuse CP and DPS.

> The term "Power" will never be used anywhere on this site to mean "Combat Power".

### STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus)
When a Pokemon uses a Move that matches one of its own Types, said Move deals 25% extra damage.

> Charizard, a **Fire/Flying-type** Pokemon, knows the Fast Move **Air Slash** (Flying-type), and has two Charge Moves, **Overheat** (Fire-type) and **Dragon Claw** (Dragon-type).\
Charizard deals 25% extra damage due to STAB when using **Fire Spin** or **Air Slash**, but not when using **Dragon Claw**.

### TDO (Total Damage Output)
A number used to note the total amount of damage a specific Pokemon can mathematically deal against a specific opponent before fainting. This is rarely used as a useful metric, as it is dependant on the defending Pokemon's stats, as well as [DPS](#dps-damage-per-second) almost always being a more relevant and helpful measure to compare Pokemon by.

> A Pokemon with higher TDO is likely due to it having more "[bulk](#bulk)".

### Toggle
When a Pokemon has only two possible Moves it can learn in a category (either Fast or Charge), using the proper TM on said Pokemon will *always* result in the currently not-known Move being learned. This means the forgotten Move can just as easily be relearned, letting the Trainer **Toggle** the Pokemon's Move with only a single Fast TM, whenever the opposite Move is desired.

> As Garchomp is a top attacker for both Dragon and Ground-type, unlocking a second Charge Move will let it know both **Earthquake** (Ground) and **Outrage** (Dragon). At that point, you can use a single Fast TM to **toggle** the Fast Move between **Mud Shot** (Ground) and **Dragon Tail** (Dragon), depending on which Type of Moveset you need at the time, letting your Garchomp serve either role with ease.
