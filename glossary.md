# Glossary of Terms

Not all Pokemon are created equal, but it's important to know how to get the best out of the Pokemon that you have.

### Toggle
When a Pokemon has only two possible Moves it can learn in a category (either Fast or Charge), using the proper TM on said Pokemon will *always* result in the currently not-known Move being learned. This means the forgotten Move can just as easily be relearned, letting the Trainer **Toggle** the Pokemon's Move with only a single Fast TM, whenever the opposite Move is desired.

> As Garchomp is a top attacker for both Dragon and Ground-type, unlocking a second Charge Move will let it know both **Earthquake** (Ground) and **Outrage** (Dragon). At that point, you can use a single Fast TM to **toggle** the Fast Move between **Mud Shot** (Ground) and **Dragon Tail** (Dragon), depending on which Type of Moveset you need at the time, letting your Garchomp serve either role with ease.
