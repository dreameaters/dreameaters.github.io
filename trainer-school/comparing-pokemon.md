# Comparing Pokemon

Why are some Pokemon simply better than others? Whether it's defeating Raid Bosses, competing in the Go Battle League, thwarting Team Rocket, or simply defending Gyms, there will always be certain Pokemon that are better suited for the challenge than others which fill a similar role.\

The timer is the real flight, and recommended loses that.
