# Sitemap

Full sitemap, built manually. Ideally kept updated. Mostly used for site/folder structure planning.

1. [Psychic Starter](#moveset---break-out-those-tms-or-not)
{:toc}


# [Trainer School]
Guides on game mechanics, Pokemon builds & statistics, and how to get (and best ways to use) rare items/Pokemon.
## [Building a Good Pokemon](/building-a-good-pokemon/)
  Deep-dive into building your Pokemon. Movesets, levels, IVs, and more.
## Comparing Pokemon
  ??
## Rare Items & How to Use Them
  ??


# [Advanced Guides]
This should not be a drop-down. Instead, a page similar to Docs. Indexes stand-alone guides on complex information.
## Event Moves, Legendaries, Megas, and Shadow Pokémon. How important are they?
Compare vanilla Pokémon to each of those categories, and show how important, or unimportant, the differences are.
Break down by type, to get further into detail. (Note how this is mostly only important if short-manning.)\
Also, offer suggestions on what non-vanilla options are worth the investment, and which are negligible. (Almost all of my research on this is already complete, but now that Megas are established I'll need to look into those to round out this analysis for my documentation.)


# [Teambuilding]
Guides on top Pokemon, how to get them, and how to build them. Divided by stages of play.
## Under Lv30
  A focus on Team Go Rocket battles, purifying Pokemon to get quick Lv25 attackers.
## Lv30+
  A focus on Raiding, and weather-boosted wild spawns.
## The Very Best (Lv40~)
  Detailing the nitty-gritty of top IVs, Shadow Pokemon, and other very expensive & low-return ways to make perfect teams.


# [Pokemon Rankings]
External links to sheets of Pokemon, ranked in my own style.
## Top Attackers
  Pokemon divided by type, ranked in their effectiveness in Raids. Mostly based on DPS, with bias toward STAB and doubles.
## Mega Rankings
  All Mega Evolutions divided by type, and given a 5✰ rating for usefulness in Mega Boost, extra candy, PvE, and PvP.


# [PvP]
