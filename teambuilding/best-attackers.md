# Outclassed - There's always someone better than you.

## Bug - Caterpie & Friends Can't Hack It!
Never meant to be big bois.
### Genesect - Metabee?
### Pinsir - Vicegrip (but don't use that)

## Fairy
Defensive af, leaves nothing left for offense.
### Gardevoir - Pretty, I guess.
### Togekiss - Eggbird
### Granbull - Mad Dog

## Flying - Getting Burnt by Mindgames
Fire and Psychic do its jobs better.
### Moltres - Sky Attack or Bust
### Honchkrow - Darkness is behind me.
### Zapdos & Rayquaza - Quell the Storm

## Poison - It'd rather use a sword.
Grass/Poison is very common, and Steel beats Fairy better. (Still worth something against it?)
### Gengar - Ghosts and Ghosts and Ghosts
### Roserade - Why so Toxic?

## Normal - Nothing to see here.
No STAB and only 2x resistance on Ghost means it's never good for attacking.
