# Best Attackers to Train

This article serves to give an analysis and breakdown of the various top performing Pokemon in terms of battling Raid Bosses. The main aspect important in an attacker is high DPS (Damage Per Second), meaning that bulkier Pokemon with high Defense or HP won't be as useful. Pokemon with simply high Attack, and powerful moves, will prevail here. Also, it's a high priority for attackers to exclusively use moves matching one of their Types, like a Fire-type Pokemon using a Fire-type move, as it would gain STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), making the move 25% more powerful. Finally, having a moveset where both moves are the same Type is commonly called a "Double-[type]" moveset, and is almost always ideal.

> Charizard, a Fire/Flying-type Pokemon, with the Fast Move of **Fire Spin** and the Charge Move of **Blast Burn** would be considered to have a **Double-Fire Moveset**, allowing it to constantly deal Super-Effective damage on a Bug, Grass, or Ice-type opponent, and would deal 25% more damage due to STAB with both moves.

# Major Types

These are the Types that you'll get the most use out of, simply due to the fact that lots of 5⭐ and Mega Raid Bosses are weak to them.

## Dark-Type
### Darkrai - Shadow of Nightmares
![Darkrai](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/darkrai.png)

> Snarl + Dark Pulse
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Darkrai is the best Dark-type in the game, and will likely keep that title forever. It's found only in 5⭐ Raids, and is classified as a Mythical Pokemon, meaning that it's unable to be traded. Pummeling it with a lobby of other Trainers, all using their best Fighting-types, is gonna be your only means of catching it. But it will be well worth it, as it's one of the most valuable Raid Bosses in the game, and serves as both the top Dark-type attacker as well as the top Ghost-type attacker, despite not being Ghost-type itself. More info on that [here.](#darkrai---thats-no-ghost){:.heading.flip-title}

### Weavile & Honchkrow - Dark Sinnoh Evolutions
![Weavile](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/weavile.png)![Honchkrow](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/honchkrow.png)

> Snarl + Foul Play
{:.note title="Weavile Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Snarl + Sky Attack
{:.note title="Honchkrow Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Weavile and Honchkrow perform very similarly when Honchkrow uses **Dark Pulse** instead of **Sky Attack**, so I'm covering them together. When Honchkrow uses the optimal **Sky Attack** rather than going with a **Double-Dark Moveset** to match Weavile, it's much like Darkrai instead.\
Weavile evolves from Sneasel, and Honchkrow from Murkrow. Both require 100 Candy and a Sinnoh Stone to evolve. These Pokemon are both regularly uncommon, with Sneasel showing up more easily during Snowy weather. It will take some time, but should be a pretty consistent grind to get either of these two, and they're always worth catching. (Though Murkrow has a pretty annoying catch rate. Razz Berries recommended.)

> Noting that Honchkrow uses **Sky Attack** as its Charge Move, it can learn **Dark Pulse** instead at the cost of 16.7% DPS (damage per second) in exchange for a **Double-Dark Moveset**. This makes it on par with Weavile, rather than Darkrai.
{:.note title="Note: Double-Dark Honchkrow"}

### Hydreigon - Tyrant Dragon
![Hydreigon](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/hydreigon.png)

> Bite + Dark Pulse
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Hydreigon is a powerful Dark-type attacker, if you can manage to get one. The base-stage, Deino, is only available from Go Battle League reward encounters, and 12km red eggs (at the time of writing this). So it's bound to be a big grind, a lot of walking, or a large Rare Candy investment to get it fully evolved up with 125 Candy. But if you get one, it's one of the most solid Dark-types in the game. With respectable bulk and *plenty* of power, Hydreigon is sure to serve you well if you can get your hands on it.

### Houndoom - Hell Hound
![Houndoom](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/houndoom.png)

> Snarl + Foul Play
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Houndoom can be easy to get if you find many Fire-types in the wild near you, or if its Mega Evolution is currently in Raids. Houndour can also be rescued from Team Go Rocket Grunts. However you get it, Houndoom is a great Dark-type to have, especially early on, and the potential to Mega Evolve it is a great bonus.

### Tyranitar - The Old King
![Tyranitar](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/tyranitar.png)

> Confusion/Zen Headbutt + Psychic
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The greatest Dark-type attacker back in the day, Tyranitar is still a force to be reckoned with today. If you have some from back in its glory days, they're as good as they every were, it's just that now some newer Pokemon have surpassed them. If you don't have any yet, they're still a great Pokemon to train up. Catch it when it comes to 3✰ Raids, evolve a Shadow/Purified Larvitar, or stock up on wild catches when they're part of an event. With a Mega Evolution releasing later on, Tyranitar is sure to be sticking around.

> Shadow Tyranitar is an absolute beast, and though I'm not detailing Shadow Pokemon in this article, check out [Shadow Pokemon](/go/teambuilding/shadow-pokemon/) if you want to learn more. (Recommended Lv35+)
{:.note title="To purify or not..."}


## Dragon-Type
### Rayquaza - King of Dragons
![Rayquaza](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/rayquaza.png)

> Confusion/Zen Headbutt + Psychic
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Espeon is the #1 vanilla Psychic-type, and will be good forever.

### Dialga - Shielded Dragon
![Dialga](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/dialga.png)

> Confusion/Zen Headbutt + Psychic
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Espeon is the #1 vanilla Psychic-type, and will be good forever.

### Salamence & Dragonite - Rayquaza's Grunts
![Salamence](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/salamence.png)![Dragonite](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/dragonite.png)

> Confusion/Zen Headbutt + Psychic

Espeon is the #1 vanilla Psychic-type, and will be good forever.

### Haxorus & Garchomp - Dragons of Myth
![Haxorus](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/haxorus.png)![Garchomp](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/garchomp.png)

### Zekrom & Reshiram - Far From Home
![Zekrom](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/zekrom.png)![Reshiram](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/reshiram.png)

{:.note title="Reshiram's Moveset"}

Both strong Dragons, but extremely top their other types, Electric and Fire respectively.


## Rock-Type
### Rampardos - Extinct for a reason.

### Rhyperior - Arm Cannons

### Terrakion - The Sword of Justice

### Tyranitar - Godzilla of Old

## Fire-Type
### Reshiram - Lord of Fire
![Reshiram](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/reshiram.png)

> Transform + Struggle
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

### Darmanitan - Gurilla Tactics
![Darmanitan](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/darmanitan-standard.png)

> Transform + Struggle
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

### Chandelure - Will-o-Wisp
![Chandelure](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/chandelure.png)

> Transform + Struggle
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

### Blaziken - From Good to Great!
![Blaziken](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/blaziken.png)

> Counter + Blast Burn†
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Counter + Blaze Kick
{:.note title="Vanilla Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Using **Fire Spin** instead of **Counter** For Blaziken's Fast Move gives you a **Double-Fire Moveset**, while only sacrificing 2.5% damage. If the Raid Boss you're battling isn't weak to Fighting, it's a worthwhile swap, even if it means simply toggling it with a Fast TM.

### Moltres - Rising Phoenix!
![Moltres](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/moltres.png)

> Transform + Struggle
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

### Charizard & Infernape - Blast Burn!!
![Charizard](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/charizard.png)![Infernape](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/infernape.png)

> Transform + Struggle
{:.note title="Charizard Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Transform + Struggle
{:.note title="Infernape Moveset"}
{:.faded}

### Entei & Heatran - Volcanic Legends!
![Entei](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/entei.png)![Heatran](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/heatran.png)

> Fire Fang + Overheat
{:.note title="Entei Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Transform + Struggle
{:.note title="Heatran Moveset"}
{:.faded}

### Flareon - Hot Dog
![Flareon](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/flareon.png)

> Fire Spin + Overheat/Flamethrower
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

**Overheat** is less than 1% DPS stronger than **Flamethrower**, so either is perfectly fine. Just be sure to replace **Fire Blast** if you have it, as it's far worse than the other two. (Also the Elite Move **Last Resort**, if evolved during a special event. It's only used in Go Battle League.)

## Fighting-Type
### Lucario - The Aura Warrior
![Lucario](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/lucario.png)

> Transform + Struggle
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

### Conkeldurr - Bigger Machamp
![Conkeldurr](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/conkeldurr.png)

> Transform + Struggle
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

### Machamp - The OG MVP
![Machamp](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/machamp.png)

> Counter + Dynamic Punch
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Counter + Close Combat
{:.note title="B-Tier Moveset"}
{:.faded}

**Close Combat** does soften Machamp's impact noticeably, but as Machamp has 5 different Charge Moves, you could easily burn several Charge TMs trying to swap to **Dynamic Punch**. So if you're short on Charge TMs, sticking with **Close Combat** can be good enough until you have some extras to gamble with, but know that **Dynamic Punch** is definitely worth the upgrade.

### Breloom & Hariyama - Two Halves of Machamp
![Breloom](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/breloom.png)![Hariyama](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/hariyama.png)

> Mud-Slap + Earthquake
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset for both"}
{:.faded}

As it takes 100 Candy to evolve Rhydon to Rhyperior (plus a Sinnoh Stone), you would be best off just using that candy to get more Rhydon first if you're on a budget. You can always evolve your Rhydon army into a Rhyperior army later on, but having multiple Rhydon will be more useful to fill out a starting Ground-type Party than a single Rhyperior. Just remember that of course the evolution is always an upgrade, so long as you already have 6 Pokemon to fill your Party.

# Outclassed

The Types listed here are almost never useful for Raiding, either due to terrible Attack stats, bad moves, or simply existing in the shadow of another Type that counters its targets better. Trainers generally ignore these Types when building Raid Parties, but as everyone has their favorite Types and may want to know how they can get the most out of them, I'm including them in this article mostly for the sake of completion. Be warned though that I will be ripping into them pretty hard, as I have almost nothing good to say about their capabilities as attackers. Several of them have better uses in [Go Battle League](/go/pvp/), but you'll have to read about that on another section of the site.

## Bug-Type
Never meant to be big bois.
### Genesect - Metabee?
![Genesect](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/genesect.png)

> Fury Cutter + X-Scissor
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Genesect is as good as Bug-types get. Hosting the lowest DPS of any Type's #1 slot, Genesect also holds the "honor" of being a Mythical Pokemon, locked behind a Special Research, 5⭐ Raids, and being unable to be traded. So not only is the best Bug-type the worst #1, but it's also about as complicated as it gets to obtain. To top it all off, Genesect performs a bit better as a [Steel-type attacker](#genesect---death-metal-bug), while also being outclassed by 4 or 5 better Steel-types.\
If you want a big Bug-type, this is it. Though its runner-up is just barely below it, and much easier to catch. Keep scrolling.

### Pinsir - Vicegrip (but don't use that)
![Pinsir](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/pinsir.png)

> Bug Bite + X-Scissor
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Pinsir is generally uncommon in the wild, and has been Jessie's catchable Shadow Pokemon for a while now, making it quite easy to get your hands on (especially as purifying the Shadow will get you a Lv25 easily). As Genesect is only slightly better offensively, most players will do just fine relying on Pinsir, or to a slightly lesser degree any of the budget Bug-types I've written about in [The Budget Dream Team.](budget-dream-team.md){:.heading.flip-title}
{:.read-more}

## Fairy-Type
Defensive af, leaves nothing left for offense.
### Gardevoir - Pretty, I guess.
![Gardevoir](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/gardevoir.png)

> Charm + Dazzling Gleam
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Gardevoir is one of Kirlia's evolutions (base-form being Ralts), along with Gallade (which has no place here). This already means it's going to take a good while to collect enough candy to get evolved, being 125 from a rare wild spawn. Once you get there though, you have the second worst Type leader (only ahead of Genesect representing Bug-type). Gardevoir boasts solid Defense, and very lackluster Attack, making it horrible for attacking Raids. This is as good as Fairy-type gets though, so if you really want a hard-hitting Fairy, this is the closest you'll find.

### Togekiss - Eggbird

Togekiss is the final stage of Togepi. Meaning you either have to hatch a Togepi (only ocassionally in Eggs) and give it 125 candy, or capture Togetic from 3⭐ Raids when it's around and use 100 candy. It's a hard to get Pokemon, either way, and in the end it's not worth Raiding with. It has use in [Go Battle League](../pvp/), but that's not what we're talking about here.

### Granbull - Mad Dog

The only Fairy-type up here that can be found with any sort of ease. Snubbull around in the wild every now and then, and only takes 50 candy to evolve into Granbull. Granbull isn't even very far behind Togekiss or even Gardevoir in terms of attacking Raid Bosses, so it's much more worth your time and effort to just worry about grabbing a few of these if you really want Fairy-types for a Raid Party, for some reason. I should remind you though, there are better types out there.

## Flying-Type
Fire and Psychic do its jobs better.
### Moltres - Sky Attack or Bust

## Poison-Type
Grass/Poison is very common, and Steel beats Fairy better. (Still worth something against it?)
### Gengar - Ghosts and Ghosts and Ghosts

> Shadow Claw + Sludge Bomb
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}

[As discussed in the Ghost-type section](#gengar---now-you-see-me-now-you-dont), Gengar hits very hard and gets hit very hard in return. This holds true as a Poison-type attacker, boasting only slightly lower DPS (1% less than a **Double-Ghost Moveset**). If you have a good Gengar, you should already know to give it Ghost-type moves, but if you have a full team of Pokemon better than it (minus keeping one to Mega Evolve), then maybe you can give it new life with **Sludge Bomb**, however rarely it may be used.

### Roserade - Why so Toxic?
![Roserade](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/roserade.png)

> Poison Jab + Sludge Bomb
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The only **Double-Poison Moveset** worth talking about here. There are several in [The Budget Dream Team](budget-dream-team.md) but none that hit hard enough to warrant a slot on this page. Once again, it's a Pokemon we've already covered, this time in the [Grass-type section](#roserade---beauty-and-thorns), Roserade. The same goes here as it does for Gengar. You should already be using Roserade as a Grass-type attacker (especially as it's #1), but if you have tons or just love Poison-type, then sure, do this I guess.


## Normal-Type
No STAB and only 2x resistance on Ghost means it's never good for attacking.
