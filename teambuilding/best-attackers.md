# Best Attackers to Train

> Added [Thundurus Therian Forme](#thundurus-therian-forme---not-a-genie) as 2nd best Electric-type.
{:.note title="March 17th Update"}
{:.faded}

This article serves to give an analysis and breakdown of the various top performing Pokemon in terms of battling Raid Bosses. The main aspect important in an attacker is high DPS (Damage Per Second), meaning that bulkier Pokemon with high Defense or HP won't be as useful. Pokemon with simply high Attack, and powerful moves, will prevail here. Also, it's a high priority for attackers to exclusively use moves matching one of their Types, like a Fire-type Pokemon using a Fire-type move, as it would gain STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), making the move 25% more powerful. Finally, having a moveset where both moves are the same Type is commonly called a "Double-[type]" moveset, and is almost always ideal.

> Charizard, a Fire/Flying-type Pokemon, with the Fast Move of **Fire Spin** and the Charge Move of **Blast Burn** would be considered to have a **Double-Fire Moveset**, allowing it to constantly deal Super-Effective damage on a Bug, Grass, or Ice-type opponent, and would deal 25% more damage due to STAB with both moves.

# Major Types

These are the Types that you'll get the most use out of, simply due to the fact that lots of 5✰ and Mega Raid Bosses are weak to them. You'll no doubt want a full Party of six for each of these Types, eventually hosting the most powerful of each category.

## Dark-Type

**Dark-type** Pokemon will be your best friends against **Psychic-types** like Mewtwo, Latios, Lugia, Cresselia, and more. Dealing Super-Effective damage while also boasting a 2x Resistance to Psychic-type moves, Dark-type Pokemon will hit hard, and survive very well at the same time.\
They'll also help you deal with **Ghost-types** well enough, hitting for weakness again, while taking neutral damage in return.

### Darkrai - Shadow of Nightmares
![Darkrai](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/darkrai.png)

> Snarl + Dark Pulse
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Darkrai is the best Dark-type in the game, and will likely keep that title forever. It's found only in 5✰ Raids, and is classified as a Mythical Pokemon, meaning that it's unable to be traded. Pummeling it with a lobby of other Trainers, all using their best Fighting-types, is gonna be your only means of catching it. But it will be well worth it, as it's one of the most valuable Raid Bosses in the game, and serves as both the top Dark-type attacker as well as the top [Ghost-type attacker](#darkrai---thats-no-ghost), despite not being Ghost-type itself.

### Weavile & Honchkrow - Dark Sinnoh Evolutions
![Weavile](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/weavile.png)![Honchkrow](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/honchkrow.png)

> Snarl + Foul Play
{:.note title="Weavile Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Snarl + Sky Attack
{:.note title="Honchkrow Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Weavile and Honchkrow perform very similarly when Honchkrow uses **Dark Pulse** instead of **Sky Attack**, so I'm covering them together. When Honchkrow uses the optimal **Sky Attack** rather than going with a **Double-Dark Moveset** to match Weavile, it's much like Darkrai instead.\
Weavile evolves from Sneasel, and Honchkrow from Murkrow. Both require 100 Candy and a Sinnoh Stone to evolve. These Pokemon are both regularly uncommon, with Sneasel showing up more easily during Snowy weather. It will take some time, but should be a pretty consistent grind to get either of these two, and they're always worth catching. (Though Murkrow has a pretty annoying catch rate. Razz Berries recommended.)

> Noting that Honchkrow uses **Sky Attack** as its Charge Move, it can learn **Dark Pulse** instead at the cost of 16.7% DPS (damage per second) in exchange for a **Double-Dark Moveset**. This makes it on par with Weavile, rather than Darkrai.
{:.note title="Note: Double-Dark Honchkrow"}

### Hydreigon - Tyrant Dragon
![Hydreigon](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/hydreigon.png)

> Bite + Dark Pulse
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Hydreigon is a powerful Dark-type attacker, if you can manage to get one. The base-stage, Deino, is only available from Go Battle League reward encounters, and 12km red eggs (at the time of writing this). So it's bound to be a big grind, a lot of walking, or a large Rare Candy investment to get it fully evolved up with 125 Candy. But if you get one, it's one of the most solid Dark-types in the game. With respectable bulk and *plenty* of power, Hydreigon is sure to serve you well if you can get your hands on it.

### Houndoom - Hell Hound
![Houndoom](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/houndoom.png)

> Snarl + Foul Play
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Houndoom can be easy to get if you find many Fire-types in the wild near you, or if its Mega Evolution is currently in Raids. Houndour can also be rescued from Team Go Rocket Grunts. However you get it, Houndoom is a great Dark-type to have, especially early on, and the potential to Mega Evolve it is a great bonus.

### Tyranitar - The Old King
![Tyranitar](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/tyranitar.png)

> Bite + Crunch
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The greatest Dark-type attacker back in the day, Tyranitar is still a force to be reckoned with today. If you have some from back in its glory days, they're as good as they ever were, it's just that now some newer Pokemon have surpassed them. If you don't have any yet, they're still a great Pokemon to train up. Catch it when it comes to 3✰ Raids, evolve a Shadow/Purified Larvitar, or stock up on wild catches when they're part of an event. With a Mega Evolution releasing later on, Tyranitar is sure to be sticking around.

> Shadow Tyranitar is an absolute beast, and though I'm not detailing Shadow Pokemon in this article, check out [Shadow Pokemon](/go/teambuilding/shadow-pokemon/) if you want to learn more. (Recommended Lv35+)
{:.note title="To purify or not..."}


## Dragon-Type

Super-effective against their own kind, **Dragon-types** are a bit of a double-edged sword, but they also happen to be some of the strongest Pokemon in existence. Though they faint quickly to each other, they're also the quickest at taking each other down. You're bound to amass a great collection of powerful Dragons eventually, and until then, **Ice-types** will help you wear them down to capture for yourself.

### Rayquaza - King of Dragons
![Rayquaza](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/rayquaza.png)

> Dragon Tail + Outrage
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Rayquaza is the strongest Dragon-type there is. With a Mega Evolution coming at some point, it's only going to get stronger. The best part of this is that two Trainers with Lv25 Mamoswine, Galarian Darmanitan, Glaceon, and/or Weavile can defeat it. If it's Snowing, it's easy. If the Pokemon are above Lv25, also easy. For one of the most powerful Pokemon in the game, and the best Dragon-type all around, Rayquaza is incredibly easy to get. It's just a matter of waiting for it to show up in 5✰ Raids.

### Dialga - Shielded Dragon
![Dialga](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/dialga.png)

> Dragon Breath + Draco Meteor
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Due to the secondary Steel-typing, Dialga is the only Dragon-type Pokemon to *not* be weak to Dragon itself. That incredible fact combined with great DPS, makes it an extremely important Pokemon to have. Unfortunately, it's only been in 5✰ Raids very few times since it was first released in early 2019. Everyone is eagerly awaiting this truly Legendary Dragon's return. Be sure to catch as many as you can once it's available again.

> With Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl versions releasing on Nintendo Switch late this year, expect both Dialga and its counterpart Palkia to return to raids in celebration of the release.
{:.note}

### Salamence & Dragonite - Rayquaza's Grunts
![Salamence](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/salamence.png)![Dragonite](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/dragonite.png)

> Dragon Tail + Outrage*
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Dragon Tail + Draco Meteor*
{:.note title="B-Tier Moveset"}
{:.faded}

These two are very similar, sharing the Dragon/Flying-typing as well as having the exact same best, and second best, movesets. They also share their types and moves with the great Rayquaza. Salamence has a little more Attack and a little less Defense, while Dragonite is the opposite. We know that offense is preferred, so generally Salamence is the better option, but they're both so close that it doesn't make much of a difference. Speaking of not much difference, their B-Tier Moveset is nearly as good as their Optimal Moveset (~2.5% DPS difference).\
Additionally, Salamence will get a Mega Evolution at some point in the future, while Dragonite will not.

> *Dragonite has **Outrage** as a normal move, learnable by regular Charge TM, while **Draco Meteor** is an Elite Move learnable only during certain events or via Elite Charge TM. The opposite is true for Salamence.
{:.note title="Important! Elite Moves"}

### Haxorus & Garchomp - Dragons of Myth
![Haxorus](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/haxorus.png)![Garchomp](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/garchomp.png)

> Dragon Tail + Dragon Claw
{:.note title="Haxorus' Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Dragon Tail + Outrage
{:.note title="Garchomp's Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Both Haxorus and Garchomp are extremely rare in the wild (spawning as Axew and Gible respectively), but if you can get either of them, they're absolute powerhouses. If you want big Dragons like Dragonite and Salamence, but without the Flying-type added onto them, these two are exactly what you're looking for.\
Garchomp is also a wonderful [Ground-type attacker](#garchomp---landshark).

### Palkia - Pearlescent Dragon
![Palkia](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/palkia.png)

> Dragon Tail + Draco Meteor
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Palkia trades in the resistance of Dialga for extra power, and a secondary Water-typing. Unlike Dialga's Steel-type, Water does nothing special for Palkia. This doesn't mean Palkia should be ignored. Boasting DPS comparable to Salamence, without all the candy needed to evolve, Palkia is yet another powerhouse of a Dragon-type, well worth the stardust investment.

> With Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl versions releasing on Nintendo Switch late this year, expect both Dialga and Palkia to return to raids in celebration of the release.
{:.note}

### Zekrom & Reshiram - Far From Home
![Zekrom](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/zekrom.png)![Reshiram](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/reshiram.png)

> Dragon Breath + Outrage
{:.note title="Zekrom's Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Dragon Breath + Draco Meteor
{:.note title="Reshiram's Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The black and white Dragons, representing ideals and truth. The truth is that these Dragon-types are ideally used for their secondary typings of Electric and Fire respectively. However, if you find yourself swimming in them with no other Dragons in sight, then they still do well using **Double-Dragon Movesets**.

See how Zekrom dominates the [Electric-type category here](#zekrom---lord-of-thunder).
See how Reshiram dominates the [Fire-type category here](#reshiram---lord-of-fire).


## Rock-Type

Rock and roll! **Rock-type** Pokemon lead the pack in defeating both **Flying-type** and **Fire-type** Pokemon. If you're lacking in other types, they can also take down most **Ice-types** well enough. Plus, if you have any **Bug-types** to squish, rather than burn, then **Rock-type** Pokemon will server you well.

### Rampardos - Extinct for a reason.
![Rampardos](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/rampardos.png)

> Smack Down + Rock Slide
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

No other Rock-type attacker comes close to the raw power of Rampardos. However, offense is all it has. This ancient beast can hardly take a hit, and trades away the Rock-type's signature high defense in exchange for absolute crushing power. Rarely found in the wild (as Cranidos), it's worth Powering-Up for the massive hits it will deal before quickly falling itself, and should lead any Rock-type Raid Party for quick damage right at the start of the fight.

### Rhyperior & Terrakion - Different Rare Gems
![Rhyperior](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/rhyperior.png)![Terrakion](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/terrakion.png)

> Smack Down + Rock Wrecker†
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Smack Down + Rock Slide
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

With very similar stats, and a rare limiter on accessibility, deciding between these top Rock-type attackers only comes down to which you can personally get. Rhyperior requires its Elite Charge Move, **Rock Wrecker†**, originally gotten on its Community Day, while Terrakion is a Legendary Pokemon found only in 5✰ Raids. Both should fill the gap right behind Rampardos, and fare better than any remaining Rock-type options.

### Tyranitar - Godzilla of Old
![Tyranitar](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/tyranitar.png)

> Smack Down† + Stone Edge
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Bite + Stone Edge
{:.note title="B-Tier Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Regarded as the best Rock-type attacker for a long time, Tyranitar has since been one-upped by the newer Pokemon listed above. Don't let this lead you to think that Tyranitar isn't worth your attention though. It still hits as hard as ever, and that's *very* hard. It's old Community Day move, **Smack Down†**, will give the **Double-Rock Moveset** you ideally want, but **Bite** is regularly accessible and matches it for DPS, while still getting STAB from Tyranitar's Dark-typing. However, if your opponent isn't also weak to Dark, then you're missing out on Super-Effective damage.

## Fire-Type

The searing flames of **Fire-type** Pokemon should be your first pick for dealing with **Grass**, **Ice**, or **Steel-type** Pokemon. With *many* powerful Pokemon in this Type, every Trainer is sure to have a good roster of **Fire-types** ready to blaze through the competition.

### Reshiram - Lord of Fire
![Reshiram](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/reshiram.png)

> Fire Fang + Overheat
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Reshiram is the ultimate Fire-type attacker. Only caught in 5✰ Raids, the vast white Dragon of truth will dominate any Grass, Ice, Bug, or Steel-types that you throw it at. Though it also fares well with a [**Double-Dragon Moveset**](#zekrom--reshiram---far-from-home), the Fire-type is where it truly is without match.

### Darmanitan - Gurilla Tactics
![Darmanitan](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/darmanitan-standard.png)

> Fire Fang + Overheat
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The best vanilla Fire-type attacker, Darmanitan, can be hard to come by. A very rare spawn of Darumaka in the wild, or from eggs, is always a welcome sight. The Fire-type has many top attackers, but you'll quickly see that most are pretty hard to get. When you can, use your Pinap Berries on wild Darumaka, even if it's the Glaraian Ice-type variant. The candies still count.

### Chandelure - Will-o-Wisp
![Chandelure](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/chandelure.png)

> Fire Spin + Overheat
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Close to Darmanitan in power, the catch with Chandelure is that its base form (Litwik) is almost exclusively found in the wild during Halloween events. So be sure to stock up when the spooky season is around. Beyond that, the mid-stage (Lampent) is often a potential encounter in the Go Battle League, as of a certain Rank.

### Blaziken - From Good to Great!
![Blaziken](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/blaziken.png)

> Counter + Blast Burn†
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Counter + Blaze Kick
{:.note title="Vanilla Moveset"}
{:.faded}

As with most Fire-type starter Pokemon, Blaziken gets the Elite Charge Move **Blast Burn**. With it, this brawling bird surpasses Darmanitan in pure power, still ending up shy of Reshiram's greatness. Without it, Blaziken finds its place just below Chandelure. Either way, take note that the prefered Fast Move on Blaziken is **Counter**, which is a Fighting-type move. It will still gain STAB, due to Blaziken's second type, but be aware of your opponent's weaknesses.\
Using **Fire Spin** instead of **Counter** For Blaziken's Fast Move gives you a **Double-Fire Moveset**, while only sacrificing 2.5% damage. If the Raid Boss you're battling isn't weak to Fighting, it's a worthwhile swap, even if it means simply toggling it with a Fast TM.

### Moltres - Rising Phoenix!
![Moltres](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/moltres.png)

> Fire Spin + Overheat
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Finally another Legendary for the Fire-type. Moltres works better as a [Flying-type attacker](#moltres---sky-attack-or-bust), but that's not something you'll need nearly as often as you'll need Fire. Close to a Blaziken sans **Blast Burn†**, Moltres is a reliable Fire-type, and comes around to 5✰ Raids pretty often.

### Charizard & Infernape - Blast Burn!!
![Charizard](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/charizard.png)![Infernape](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/infernape.png)

> Fire Spin + Blast Burn†
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Sharing a Moveset, and both relying on the Elite Move **Blast Burn†**, Charizard and Infernape are solid Fire-type options. Without **Blast Burn†**, they fall short of greatness and can not be considered top picks by any means. Good if you have nothing else on this list, but more on that is left to [The Budget Dream Team](/go/teambuilding/budget-dream-team).

> Charizard has not one, but *two* Mega Evolutions. Mega Charizard Y turns Charizard into a beast, surpassing Reshiram, while Mega Charizard X trades its Flying-typing in for the Dragon-type (and remains a great Fire-type attacker, but not as incredible as the Y variant).

### Entei & Heatran - Volcanic Legends!
![Entei](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/entei.png)![Heatran](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/heatran.png)

> Fire Fang + Overheat
{:.note title="Entei Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Fire Spin + Flamethrower
{:.note title="Heatran Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Two more Legendary Pokemon, nearly similar in terms of attacking power. Entei and Heatran aren't uncommon Bosses in 5✰ Raids. The main difference between the two is Heatran's secondary Steel-typing, with Entei being purely Fire-type. With Entei hitting a *tiny* bit harder, and Heatran's Steel-typing, its very situational which has an edge over the other, but they're both solid options in general.

### Flareon - Hot Dog
![Flareon](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/flareon.png)

> Fire Spin + Overheat/Flamethrower
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Flareon, like all the Eeveelutions, is incredibly easy to get. All it takes is 25 Candy on an Eevee, no special conditions. Though, you might end up with a Vaporeon or Jolteon instead, so it's not quite as simple as it could be. But you're bound to find Eevee often enough to be able to take a shot at this fluffy fire Pokemon every now and then.\
**Overheat** is less than 1% DPS stronger than **Flamethrower**, so either is perfectly fine. Just be sure to replace **Fire Blast** if you have it, as it's far worse than the other two. (Also the Elite Move **Last Resort**, if evolved during a special event. It's only used in Go Battle League.)

## Fighting-Type

The big bruisers of the Pokemon world! **Fighting-type** Pokemon live up to their name, boasting incredible Attack power. There's no better choice for breaking apart **Rock-types**, and are *required* for facing off against **Dark-types**. Also, if you ever need to, they're the only Type that's Super-Effective against **Normal-type** Pokemon.

### Lucario - The Aura Warrior
![Lucario](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/lucario.png)

> Counter + Aura Sphere
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Lucario is far and away the best Fighting-type Pokemon in the game. With such power, of course comes extreme difficulty in obtaining one for yourself. Only found in rare eggs, hatched as Riolu, you're going to have a hard time getting one. If you do get one, it's going to need 50 Candy to evolve, and will of course need to be Powered-Up past the **Lv20** it hatches at. Finding a Lucky Friend who also has a Riolu to trade, wouldn't be a bad idea, but even then, you'd better Buddy up and start walking.

### Conkeldurr - Bigger Machamp
![Conkeldurr](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/conkeldurr.png)

> Counter + Dynamic Punch
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

A bigger Machamp, that can only be obtained through 1✰ Raids, caught as the base form Timburr. It's gonna take either a lot of low-tier Raids, a lot of Rare Candy, or a lot of walking as your Buddy to get the 125 Candy needed to fully evolve to Conkeldurr, and of course will need to be Powered-Up from **Lv20** just like Lucario. (Or **Lv25** if the Raid was Weather Boosted.)\
As I said, Conkeldurr is a bigger Machamp, but only by a bit, and Machamp is **extremely** easier to obtain. So let me be completely honest with you:

> Never raid for Conkeldurr. It's a waste of a Raid Pass to even do one Raid and then walk it. It's a waste of time walking, and a massive waste of Rare Candy. Machamp is nearly as good, and extremely accessible.
{:.note title="My Brutal Opinion"}

Now, with that out of the way, let's stop wasting time here, and move on to the real star of the show. Keep scrolling.

### Machamp - The OG MVP
![Machamp](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/machamp.png)

> Counter + Dynamic Punch
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Counter + Close Combat
{:.note title="B-Tier Moveset"}
{:.faded}

A Pokemon that new Trainers used to work hard for, excited to break into the Raid scene. Machamp used to require either a strong party of Psychic-types to fight in 4✰ Raids (when those existed), or 125 Candy from (hopefully Weather Boosted) wild Machop spawns (which are often around). Nowadays, this true champion is *much* easier to get, and just as highly regarded as ever.

* Catch a high-level wild Machop (ideally in Cloudy Weather for the Weather-Boost to increase its Level even more).
* Trade your high-level Machop for a friend's.
* Evolve to Machoke using 25 Candy.
* Evolve for **free** (due to the trade) to Machamp.

That's all it takes. Trade Evolutions have made Machamp extremely easy to get, and if you don't have anyone to swap your high-level Machop with, it's just gonna mean adding 100 Candy to the formula instead. Not a huge deal, but it's best to have a trade friend if possible. Many experienced Trainers tend to hold on to a few high-level Machop for the sake of helping out newbies, so it doesn't hurt to ask around a bit.

Finally, in terms of Movesets, **Close Combat** does soften Machamp's impact noticeably, but as Machamp has 5 different Charge Moves, you could easily burn several Charge TMs trying to swap to **Dynamic Punch**. So if you're short on Charge TMs, sticking with **Close Combat** can be good enough until you have some extras to gamble with, but know that **Dynamic Punch** is definitely worth the upgrade.

### Breloom & Hariyama - Two Halves of Machamp
![Breloom](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/breloom.png)![Hariyama](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/hariyama.png)

> Counter + Dynamic Punch
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Though they share an Optimal Moveset, these two Pokemon have noticeably different stats. Breloom hits harder, while Hariyama has more bulk. In addition, Breloom has the Grass-typing to go with its Fighting-type. Both of these Pokemon are solid alternatives to Machamp, if they happen to be common in the wild around you. (Base forms being Shroomish and Makuhita respectively.)


## Psychic-Type

Proudly including the most powerful Pokemon of all time, Mewtwo, the **Psychic-type** has been considered extremely powerful since Pokemon first began. It still holds up well to that acclaim now, tearing through **Fighting-type** Pokemon, and **Poison-types**. Even in neutral matchups, Mewtwo itself can be a reliable party member.

### Mewtwo - The Most Powerful Pokemon
![Mewtwo](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/mewtwo.png)

> Confusion + Psystrike†
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Confusion + Psychic
{:.note title="B-Tier Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> "We dreamed of creating the world's most powerful Pokemon... And we succeeded."

Dr. Fuji, *Pokemon The First Movie*
{:.figcaption}

Dr. Fuji was right, before Mewtwo blew him up, along with the entire island and science lab he was created in. Since the beginning of Pokemon, Mewtwo has always been the most powerful. With the highest attack stat of any Pokemon in the game, along with its signature move, the Elite Charge Move **Psystrike†**, being the most powerful Psychic-type Move in the game, Mewtwo is truly unmatched. Even with **Psychic** (a Charge Move Mewtwo can always learn) in place of the Elite **Psystrike†**, Mewtwo is still the top of the Psychic-type by a landslide.

This is *the* Pokemon you'll always want to catch and train.

> Mewtwo's unmatched power really skews the Psychic-type list. Just know that the remaining Psychic-types listed all have higher DPS than most top attackers of other Types. Mewtwo simply breaks the ceiling for what a #1 attacker is normally capable of.
{:.note title="Comparison Note"}

### Espeon - MVE (Most Valuable Eevee)
![Espeon](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/espeon.png)

> Confusion + Psychic
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Every Trainer should collect Espeon by walking their best Eevee for 10km, and evolving it as their buddy for 25 Candy. It's hard to find a more accessible top attacker of any Type. Espeon is the best non-legendary Psychic-type by far, and so much easier to get than any others, Legendaries included. The best of the Eeveelutions deserves highest priority for Trainers new and old.

### Latios - Big Bro
![Latios](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/latios.png)

> Zen Headbutt + Psychic
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Not to be confused with his red sister, Latias. Latios is simply the attack-oriented sibling, while Latias leans heavily into defense, which we know doesn't help us much in Raids. This blue jet dragon is a little weaker than Espeon, but the secondary Dragon-typing does grant it a few new resistances to help it hang on in a fight. Ultimately, nothing can compare to Mewtwo's otherworldly power, or Espeon's tremendous accessibility, but if you think Latios can fill a slot in your Party, it'll do a good job.

### Metagross - Super Computer
![Metagross](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/metagross.png)

> Zen Headbutt + Psychic
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Without its Elite Charge Move, **Meteor Mash†**, making it the best [Steel-type attacker](#metagross---meteor-mash-or-bust) by far, Metagross serves as a strong Psychic-type attacker with great defense and a very resistant typing. Though its base form (Beldum) is very rare, if you can get 125 Candy to fully evolve one, it's a solid option for your Psychic-type Party.


## Ice-Type

When you have no Dragons, you'll want plenty of **Ice-types**. Freezing **Dragon-type** Pokemon out of the sky, especially the ones that are also **Flying-type** (I'm looking at you, Rayquaza), these chill Pokemon will have a great place in your Raid Parties. Not to mention their use against **Ground-types**, and **Fire-types** if you lack their other counters.

### Darmanitan (Galarian) - Insert Snowman Joke
![Darmanitan](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/darmanitan-galarian-standard.png)

> Ice Fang + Avalanche
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

We've coverd the original Fire-type Darmanitan earlier in this guide, and the Ice-type Galarian variant is the exact same story, but with a Type swap. Being the most powerful Ice-type attacker by far, the egg-sclusive Galarian Daumaka is only found in 7km Eggs, so make sure you're opening your friends' gifts when you have an empty slot in your egg storage.

> Remember that regional variants share Candy, so any Darumaka Candy obtained from the Fire-type variant will also be usable on this icy cousin.

### Mamoswine - Mammoth Bulk!
![Mamoswine](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/mamoswine.png)

> Powder Snow + Avalanche
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Costing a whopping 125 Candy and a Sinnoh Stone to fully evolve from Swinub, Mamoswine is a costly investment that tells you to Pinap any wild Swinub you find. Being Weather-Boosted by both Clear and Snow weather makes finding high-level ones easy though, which means you should have one or two good ones by the time you save up enough Candy to start evolving.

With a team composed of Mamoswines, and/or the following two Pokemon (Weavile and Glaceon), you'll be tearing into Dragon-types like a pro! Some of the strongest Pokemon will fall to your might!

### Weavile - The Sword of Ice
![Weavile](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/weavile.png)

> Ice Shard + Avalanche
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Evolving from Sneasel with 100 Candy and a Sinnoh Stone, Weavile is like Mamoswine without the bulk. Fainting faster, but nearly as powerful, Weavile trails *very* close behind the frigid mammoth. If Sneasel are more common than Swinub in your neck of the woods, then it's likely your best option when it comes to Ice-types.

### Glaceon - Chilly Dog
![Glaceon](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/glaceon.png)

> Frost Breath + Avalanche
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

One of three Eeveelutions in this guide, Glaceon costs 25 Candy as you'd expect, but requires evolving your Eevee in range of a PokeStop that's equipped with a Glacial Lure Module. For efficiency's sake, gather around one of these special Lures with some friends, and make sure you all have several Eevee you're wanting to evolve into the Ice-type Glaceon.

Practically as strong as Weavile, Glaceon is made much more accessible due to how easy it is to catch Eevee, but the odd Glacial Lure evolution method does make it a little less convenient for some people.

### Mewtwo - Hey, it's me again.
![Mewtwo](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/mewtwo.png)

> Confusion + Ice Beam
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Mewtwo finds itself fitting well into various Types due to its simply high stats. Not being an Ice-type itself, nor having an Ice-type Fast Move to work with, any usual Mewtwo with **Confusion** can learn the Charge Move **Ice Beam** to suddenly make it a dominating Ice-type attacker, surpassing even Mamoswine. Granted, if your opponent isn't weak to Psychic-type, or even worse resists it, then you're better off with a proper Ice-type Pokemon for the constant Super-Effective damage.

Remember, Mewtwo is (by an *extreme* margin) [the most powerful Psychic-type Pokemon in the game](#mewtwo---the-most-powerful-pokemon), and will stay there forever. If you don't need it for the Ice-type, then build a **Double-Psychic Moveset** instead.

### Kyogre - Arctic Whale
![Kyogre](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/kyogre.png)

> Waterfall + Blizzard
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Once again, not an Ice-type Pokemon, and not having an Ice-type Fast Move, but Kyogre is still as strong as Glaceon, as long as your opponent has a weakness to Water-type moves so that **Waterfall** doesn't slow you down. You're always better off giving Kyogre a [**Double-Water Moveset**](#kyogre---leviathan-stay-tuned), but if you have no proper Ice-type attackers, Kyogre will do what you need.


## Electric-Type

Having only a single weakness in **Ground-types**, **Electric-type** Pokemon can be intimidating to battle against. Hitting Super-Effective damage against **Flying** and **Water-type** Pokemon means there are very common Pokemon that these shocking monsters can paralyze.

### Zekrom - Lord of Thunder
![Zekrom](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/zekrom.png)

> Charge Beam + Wild Charge
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Towering over its fellow Electric-types, the deep black dragon of ideals rules supreme. Only caught in 5✰ Raids, Zekrom is a Legendary worth chasing after. Though it also fares well with a [**Double-Dragon Moveset**](#zekrom--reshiram---far-from-home), the Electric-type is where it truly is truly shines.

### Thundurus (Therian Forme) - Not a Genie
![Thundurus](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/thundurus-therian.png)

> Volt Switch + Thunderbolt
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

With DPS surpassing even Zekrom, Therian Forme Thundurus hits harder than any other Electric-type attacker in the game. The *slight* increase in power compared to Zekrom comes at the cost of *far* less bulk. Normally, DPS is more important than bulk, but in this case the difference in power is so small that Zekrom's stats end up better as a whole.

Additionally, Zekrom's secondary Dragon-typing is much more useful than Thundurus' secondary Flying-type. When using an Electric-type attacker, you'd often want to resist Water-types, which Zekrom does while Thundurus does not.

### Electivire - Fists of Lightning
![Electivire](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/electivire.png)

> Thunder Shock + Wild Charge
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Costing 100 Candy and a Sinnoh Stone, this evolved form of Electabuzz packs a punch! A step above the rest of the Electric-types, Electivire makes its mark on any Electric party. Just know that it won't stick around for long, as its defense is surprisingly low for such a big Pokemon, but it will get the job done.

### Raikou - The Speed of Light
![Raikou](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/raikou.png)

> Thunder Shock + Wild Charge
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The Legendary Beast of Thunder, Raikou makes quick work of its adversaries. There's nothing too special about it, but Raikou spent quite some time being the pinnacle of Electric-type attackers, only recently usurped by the Pokemon above it. It's still great today, and is worth the investment.

### Zapdos - Pure Instinct
![Zapdos](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/zapdos.png)

> Thunder Shock† + Thunderbolt
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Charge Beam + Thunderbolt
{:.note title="B-Tier Moveset"}
{:.faded}

When blessed with its Elite Fast Move, **Thunder Shock†**, Zapdos holds up well in comparison to Raikou. Without it, Zapdos is still good, just not as good as the saber-tooth above it, or the giant magnet beneath it for that matter.\
**Thunder Shock†** is available on Zapdos from 5✰ Raids most often these days, though sometimes you'll find this Legendary Bird without it, so be wary and read the in-game news carefully when you see those spiky wings, to make sure the Elite Move is mentioned specifically.

### Magnezone - Electivire, favoring Bulk
![Magnezone](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/magnezone.png)

> Spark + Wild Charge
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Wish your Electivire stuck around a little bit longer? Well you shouldn't. You know that raw power is more important than endurance. But, if you insist (or you simply can't find Electabuzz), Magnezone is about on par with **Thunder Shock†** Zapdos. It will end up costing you 125 Magnemite Candy, as well as a Sinnoh stone.

### Mewtwo & Deoxys - Shocking DNA!
![Mewtwo](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/mewtwo.png)![Deoxys](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/deoxys-normal.png)

> Confusion/Zen Headbutt + Thunderbolt
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Though not Electric-types themselves, nor having Electric-type Fast Moves, these two Psychic-type 5✰ Bosses can deal damage close to that of Zekrom itself. If you don't have enough true Electric-type options, or your opponent is also weak to Psychic-type attacks, these two are worth bringing to the fight.

> There is a Normal, Attack, Defense, and Speed Forme to Deoxys. In terms of attacking Raids, only the Normal Forme will be of help to you. The others have different movesets, and simply don't have good enough stats to work. Normal Forme is the one shown in the image above.
{:.note title="Deoxys Many Formes"}

> Remember, Mewtwo is (by an *extreme* margin) [the most powerful Psychic-type Pokemon in the game](#mewtwo---the-most-powerful-pokemon), and will stay there forever. If you don't need it for the Ice-type, then build a **Double-Psychic Moveset** instead.
{:.note title="Mewtwo Warning"}

## Ghost-Type

Much like Dragons, **Ghost-type** Pokemon are weak and strong against each other. Though **Dark-types** have nothing to fear from these ghouls, **Ghost-types** will hit **Psychic-types** even harder than their Dark rivals. It's a real risk for reward, and when Raiding, fainting faster is always worth it to KO the Raid Boss fast as well.

### Chandelure - Will-o-Wisp
![Chandelure](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/chandelure.png)

> Hex + Shadow Ball
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Though annoying, its certainly fitting that the best Ghost-type attacker in the game is a Pokemon almost exclusively seen around Halloween. Chandelure evolves from its base form, Litwick, which only spawns in the wild during Halloween events, or from its mid-stage, Lampent, which is a potential encounter in the Go Battle League (as of a certain rank).\
This spooky piece of haunted mansion decor is definitely worth the investment, and tops the Ghost-type by a large margin, alongside the unexpected 2nd best on this list. Keep scrolling.

### Darkrai - That's no ghost!
![Darkrai](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/darkrai.png)

> Snarl + Shadow Ball
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Though it can't learn a Ghost-type Fast Move, missing out on the ideal **Double-Ghost Moveset**, Darkrai somehow ends up as the 2nd best Ghost-type attacker, and by quite a lot too. As both Ghost and Dark-types are mainly used to battle Psychic-types and their fellow Ghost-types, the mismatched Moveset is rarely an issue in practice. This is a very rare case where not having a Double-Type Moveset actually doesn't cause an issue.\
Collect Darkrai from 5✰ Raids, and know that it will serve you very well, whether as a Ghost-type attacker or more purely as a [Dark-type attacker](#darkrai---shadow-of-nightmares).

### Giratina (Origin Forme) - Chaos Itself
![Giratina](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/giratina-origin.png)

> Shadow Claw + Shadow Ball
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Origin Forme Giratina is known in legend as the being that created disorder and chaos, and it lives up to that destructive lore in battle. It's Dragon-typing will grant it handy resistances, but be careful against Raid Bosses like Latias and Latios. Reliably appearing in 5✰ Raids near Halloween time, Giratina is worth picking up whenever possible.

> Altered Forme Giratina won't be of much use at all in your Raid Party, as it trades offense for defense, which we know isn't going to help you take down a Boss.
{:.note title="Formal Warning"}

### Mewtwo - Again, but Super Rare!
![Mewtwo](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/mewtwo.png)

> Confusion + Shadow Ball†
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Before Mewtwo got its signature move **Psystrike**, it had another Elite Charge Move: **Shadow Ball**. Only able to be learned via the incredibly rare and valuable Elite Charge TMs these days, **Shadow Ball** is a hard sell, considering we have many better Ghost-type attackers these days than we had before. My advice would be, if you have a Mewtwo that knows **Shadow Ball** already, keep it and power it up, but don't bother spending an Elite Charge TM just to get it. There are much easier, and slightly better, Ghost-types to catch.

### Gengar - Now you see me, now you don't.
![Gengar](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/gengar.png)

> Shadow Claw + Shadow Ball
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Gengar has the highest DPS of all Ghost-type Pokemon. So why is it so low? Because it's made of glass and tissue paper. Gengar hits even harder than Chandelure, but will faint in so few hits that you won't know what happened. If you tend to have a lot of healing items (or no just other options), then Gengar will tear apart the battlefield better than anyone else, but it's gonna be chugging Revives and Potions faster than anything else as well.

An important note though, is that Gengar is a Trade Evolution Pokemon. Meaning that, much like Machamp in the Fighting-type category, you could trade high-level Gastly or Haunter with your friends, and evolve to Gengar for free. This accessibility simply can't be beat when it comes to Ghost-type attackers, and means that Gengar will likely make up most of any Trainer's Ghost-type parties for a while, until more sustainable options are caught.

> Gengar's Mega Evolution boosts its damage output to insane levels, though it does almost nothing for its miserable defense. With this in mind, it's worth simply dodging for as long as you can with your Mega Gengar, so that the other Trainers in your lobby will get the Mega Boost for as long as possible before this ghoul faints. The couple of hits Mega Gengar will land while trying to fight just isn't worth it in comparison. Support your teammates instead.
{:.note title="Mega Support"}

## Ground-Type

As the *only* counter to **Electric-types**, **Ground-type** Pokemon are absolutely required in any Trainer's box. Dealing well with **Steel** and **Fire-types** means that these earthly beasts will have many chances to prove their worth to you.

### Landorus (Therian Forme) - The old ones warned about this...
![Landorus](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/landorus-therian.png)

> Mud Shot + Earth Power
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The superior forme of Landorus, this legendary kami is the king of defeating Electric-type Pokemon. A very recent release at the time of writing this (actually, it's still not out until next month), Therian Forme Landorus should be the ace of any Ground-type team. Hopefully soon, we'll have the option to change the lesser Incarnate Forme into this one, but an official announcement has yet to be made.

> If you're reading this and forme changing has been added to the game, please yell at me either on Twitter [@GoDreamEaters](https://www.twitter.com/godreameaters) or via e-mail at DreamEaters.Go@gmail.com
{:.note title="Updates Coming Soon"}
{:.faded}

### Excadrill - I Dig It!
![Excadrill](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/excadrill.png)

> Mud-Slap + Drill Run
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

It's always great to have a top-placing attacker that's also accessible and easy to get. Wild Drilbur are often uncommon spawns in cities, while Excradrill itself has been known to appear in 3✰ Raids from time to time. Be sure to catch any wild spawns you encounter, and feeding them Pinap Berries means you'll quickly earn the 50 Candy needed to evolve them.

### Landorus (Incarnate Forme) - Second verse, same-ish as the first.
![Ladorus](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/landorus-incarnate.png)

> Mud Shot + Earth Power
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Landorus' lesser forme, at least in terms of attack power. The Incarnate Forme still pulls its weight, and shouldn't be ignored. It does everything that Therian Forme can, just not as well. At the very least, catching it will earn you Landorus Candy you could spend on the superior Therian Forme.

### Groudon - Behemoth (Stay Tuned!)
![Groudon](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/groudon.png)

> Mud Shot + Earthquake
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The best Ground-type attacker we had for a long time, Groudon still holds up today. Not an uncommon sight in 5✰ Raids, it's worth catching if you don't already have some. This is especially recommended if Drilbur is rare in your area, and you have no Landorus yet.

Though both Landorus and Excadrill have surpassed it, this behemoth has a few tricks left up its sleeve. Once its signature move, **Precipice Blades**, is added to the game, Groudon will likely once again be #1. Regarded in legend as the Pokemon that created the continents in ancient times, Groudon has a Mega Evolution of sorts called Primal Groudon. Though not yet released, this ancient form of Groudon is sure to rocket to the top of its Type.

### Garchomp - Landshark
![Garchomp](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/garchomp.png)

> Mud Shot + Earthquake
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Though better at using [Dragon-type attacks](#haxorus--garchomp---dragons-of-myth), Garchomp is also a great Ground-type attacker. Though its base form, Gible, is super rare in the wild, it's always worth investing in when you find a strong one. The Dragon-typing neutralizes a few of Garchomp's weakness that other Ground-types can't handle. (Grass and Water, specifically.)

> One option, though expensive, is to unlock a Second Charge Move on Garchomp, letting it know both **Earthquake** and **Outrage**. That way, you can use a single Fast TM to switch the Fast Move between **Mud Shot** and **Dragon Tail**, depending on which Type of Moveset you need at the time, letting your Garchomp serve both roles.
{:.note title="An Expensive Toggle"}

### Rhydon & Rhyperior - Rumblin' Rhynos
![Rhydon](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/rhydon.png)![Rhyperior](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/rhyperior.png)

> Mud-Slap + Earthquake
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset for both"}
{:.faded}

Taking only 25 Candy to evolve from Rhyhorn, Rhydon is very accessible, and is a great choice for how powerful it is. Though it could be considered a budget Ground-type to deal with Electric-types early on, it packs enough of a punch to be considered good for a long while after you've gotten more of a collection, before eventually evolving it.\
As it takes 100 Candy to evolve Rhydon to Rhyperior (plus a Sinnoh Stone), you would be best off just using that candy to get more Rhydon first if you're on a budget. You can always evolve your Rhydon army into a Rhyperior army later on, but having multiple Rhydon will be more useful to fill out a starting Ground-type Party than a single Rhyperior. Just remember that of course the evolution is always an upgrade, so long as you already have 6 Pokemon to fill your Party.

## Steel-Type

Nothing fares better against **Ice-types** than **Steel-type** Pokemon. Should any **Fairy-type** Pokemon give you trouble, with their high Defense, then **Steel-types** are sure to cut them down to size, like a hero's sword.

### Metagross - Meteor Mash or Bust!
![Metagross](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/metagross.png)

> Bullet Punch + Meteor Mash†
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Let's get an unfortunate truth out of the way, right at the start.\
Without **Meteor Mash†**, Metagross can't help you as a Steel-type attacker.

**Meteor Mash†** makes Metagross the best Steel-type attacker by far. With the massive defense that Steel-types are known for, combined with the huge power of **Meteor Mash†**, Metagross is what any top attacker should hope to be. The only downside would be rarity. Beldum is a very rare wild spawn, but does show up in events from time to time. Grab it when you can, and hope for an event with **Meteor Mash†** in the future.

### Dialga - Aged Steel
![Dialga](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/dialga.png)

> Metal Claw + Iron Head
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Already regarded for its incredible niche as a [Dragon-type attacker](#dialga---shielded-dragon), Dialga obviously leaves its mark high on the Steel-type ladder as well. The only Dragon/Steel-type combo in the game ensures that Dialga will hold a unique spot in notoriety regardless of future releases. Catch it whenever it appears in 5✰ Raids, and know that you have a Legendary Pokemon that lives up to the title.

### Excadrill - A drill that will pierce the heavens!
![Excadrill](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/excadrill.png)

> Metal Claw + Iron Head
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Nearly as strong of a Steel-type as it is a [Ground-type attacker](#excadrill---i-dig-it), Excadrill is also easily the most accessible Pokemon of this Type. Evolving from Drilbur with 50 Candy, it's a common wild Pokemon you'll want to use your Pinap Berries on and ideally catch in Cloudy Weather for the level boost.

### Jirachi - Make a Wish!
![Jirachi](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/jirachi.png)

> Confusion + Doom Desire
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Being a Mythical Pokemon found only in the Special Research "A Thousand Year Slumber", each Trainer will only ever get one of these wishmakers. (No trading, either.) Its exclusivity also means your best way to power it up will be by spending Rare Candies. In the end, it's a little stronger than Dialga, but without a Steel-type Fast Move. It's an option, but there are much easier ways to get good Steel-types.

> Jirachi also does very well in the Great League class of Go Battle League. So if that interests you, you'll want to keep Jirachi under 1500cp instead of powering it up high for battling Raids.
{:.note title="Great League"}

### Genesect - Death Metal Bug
![Genesect](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/genesect.png)

> Metal Claw + Magnet Bomb
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Nearly as powerful as Excadrill, Genesect is a Mythical Pokemon that has appeared in 5✰ Raids. The secondary Bug-typing makes it double-weak to Fire-types, but you shouldn't be using it against them anyway. Though the weakest of the best Steel-types, its only other use is as the best [Bug-type attacker](#genesect---metabee), which has no real use at all.

---

# B-Tier Types

These couple of Types both counter two of the same Types, and one unique Type each. In addition covering for eachother, which they both do so equally well, they both have three Types from the group above that simply do their jobs better most of the time. So, while these two Types are certainly nothing to stick your nose up to, you may eventually find yourself using them less often as you collect more powerful options.\
Listen to me though, this doesn't mean you should ignore them. They're largely accessible, and easier to train up than the Types we've covered already. They could be the quick start you've been looking for.

## Grass-Type

Outclassed by **Electric**, **Ice**, and **Fighting**, **Grass-type** Pokemon are built to counter **Water**, **Ground**, and **Rock-types**. They still work very well, but there's normally a better counter out there, if you can get one.

### Roserade - Beauty and Thorns!
![Roserade](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/roserade.png)

> Razor Leaf + Grass Knot
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The hardest-hitting Grass-type attacker, Roserade, will cost 100 Candy and a Sinnoh Stone to evolve from Roselia. No other Grass-type can tear through opponents like Roselia, making it an absolute superstar on any Grass-type Raid Party.

### Venusaur & Sceptile - Frenzy Plant!!
![Venusaur](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/venusaur.png)![Sceptile](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/sceptile.png)

> Vine Whip + Frenzy Plant†
{:.note title="Venusaur's Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Bullet Seed + Frenzy Plant†
{:.note title="Sceptile's Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The two Grass-type starter Pokemon which have the attack power to back up their exclusive Elite Charge Move, **Frenzy Plant†**. As is common in these paired listings, Venusaur has extra bulk, while Sceptile hits a harder. Generally, you'll prefer Sceptile, but wild Bulbasaur are a common inclusion during various events, making Venusaur the more accessible option for most Trainers.\
Additionally, Venusaur has the secondary Poison-typing, as well as a Mega Evolution. Sceptile will be receiving a Mega of its own in the future, but for now it will have to wait.

### Tangrowth - Objectively Flawless (citation needed)
![Tangrowth](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/tangrowth.png)

> Vine Whip + Power Whip
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The evolved form of my favorite Pokemon, Tangela, requires 100 Candy and a Sinnoh Stone, much like Roserade at the top of this Type's list. Though it doesn't hit quite as hard, it has *much* more bulk to keep it in the fight, and more importantly ditches the pesky secondary Poison-type, removing weakness to Psychic-types.


## Water-Type

Outclassed by **Ice**, **Ground**, and **Rock-types**, **Water-type** Pokemon can still hold their own and take down **Fire**, **Ground**, and **Rock-type** Pokemon.
Though **Water** and **Grass-types** share a couple purposes, they are on par with each other and will do their jobs well when needed.

### Kyogre - Leviathan (Stay Tuned!)
![Kyogre](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/kyogre.png)

> Waterfall + Surf
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The Pokemon said to have raised the tides in ancient times, Kyogre is a Legendary Pokemon that has yet to even show us its full potential, but is already an absolute beast. Nearly as devastating as the two Pokemon ranked below it on this list, but with *much* more bulk to back it up, Kyogre crashes through opponents like a tidal wave! With a Signature Move yet to be released (**Origin Pulse**), and a Mega Evolution also waiting for its time (Primal Kyogre), this leviathan is destined to become the undisputed best Water-type in the game, most likely holding that title forever.

### Kingler & Crawdaunt - Crushing Claws
![Kingler](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/kingler.png)![Crawdaunt](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/crawdaunt.png)

> Bubble + Crabhammer
{:.note title="Kingler's Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Snarl + Crabhammer
{:.note title="Crawdaunt's Moveset"}
{:.faded}

These crustaceans are the most accessible Water-types on this list. Only 50 Candy each from their base forms (Krabby & Corphish respectively), they're worth evolving whenever you find yourself a high-level one. Gifted with the unmatched **Crabhammer** (exclusive to these two Pokemon), they're both equally skilled at crushing Raid Bosses. Be wary of their fragile defense, but if you have no other Water-types that hit as hard, it's worth spending the extra healing items to just throw them back into the fight when they faint.

> Crawdaunt can swap use **Waterfall** instead of **Snarl** for it's Fast Move in order to have a **Double-Water Moveset**, sacrificing 7.8% DPS.
{:.note title="Dark Water"}

### Palkia - Rend the Tide!
![Palkia](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/palkia.png)

> Dragon Tail + Hydro Pump
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Though it doesn't learn any Water-type Fast Moves, Palkia still hits harder than any other Water-type in the game so far. Kyogre is expected to surpass it someday with its currently unreleased signature move (Origin Pulse), but until then, Palkia tops the charts on damage, and has sizable bulk to boot. Until Kyogre gets an upgrade, Palkia is the Water-type to beat.

### Swampert, Feraligatr & Empoleon - Hydro Cannon!!
<img src="https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/swampert.png" width="110">
<img src="https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/feraligatr.png" width="110">

> Water Gun + Hydro Cannon†
{:.note title="Swampert's Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Waterfall + Hydro Cannon†
{:.note title="Feraligatr & Empoleon's Moveset"}

The Elite Charge Move **Hydro Cannon†** is the signature of fully evolved Water-type starter Pokemon. It's also required for any of them to reach the DPS expected of a top attacker. Evolving your Mudkips, Totodiles, or Piplups all the way to their final stage when **Hydro Cannon†** isn't available (limited to specific events) is unfortunately a big waste. Hold out for its return, and you'll be rewarded with solid Water-type attackers.

### Gyarados - Skull Kraken!

> Waterfall + Hydro Pump
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Waterfall + Aqua Tail†
{:.note title="B-Tier Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Costing an incredible 400 Magikarp Candy to evolve, Gyarados is a big goal for many Trainers early on. It ends up being quite worth it. Though not as powerful as the **Hydro Cannon†** users, Gyarados makes up for it by always being available, and pushes its way quickly up the ranks when Mega Evolved. (Also trading the secondary Flying-type for Dark-type, for what its worth.)

> Using **Aqua Tail†** (Gyarados' Community Day Elite Move) instead of **Hydro Pump** for Gyarados' Fast Move barely loses any damage (1.4% DPS), so if you have that already, don't waste your Charge TMs swapping to **Hydro Pump**.

# Outclassed

The Types listed here are almost never useful for Raiding, either due to terrible Attack stats, bad moves, or simply existing in the shadow of another Type that counters its targets better. Trainers generally ignore these Types when building Raid Parties, but as everyone has their favorite Types and may want to know how they can get the most out of them, I'm including them in this article mostly for the sake of completion. Be warned though that I will be ripping into them pretty hard, as I have almost nothing good to say about their capabilities as attackers. Several of them have better uses in [Go Battle League](/go/pvp/), but you'll have to read about that on another section of the site.

## Bug-Type

The **Bug-type** was simply never meant to be a big deal, as sad as that is to say plainly. They can counter big Types like **Dark** and **Psychic**, as well as **Grass**, but we've already discussed ways to deal with those, and **Bug-types** have *much* lower stats to work with. Fainting faster, and not hitting very hard, it's tough to find any reason to use them in Raids.

### Genesect - Metabee?
![Genesect](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/genesect.png)

> Fury Cutter + X-Scissor
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Genesect is as good as Bug-types get. Hosting the lowest DPS of any Type's #1 slot, Genesect also holds the "honor" of being a Mythical Pokemon, locked behind a Special Research, 5✰ Raids, and being unable to be traded. So not only is the best Bug-type the worst #1, but it's also about as complicated as it gets to obtain. To top it all off, Genesect performs a bit better as a [Steel-type attacker](#genesect---death-metal-bug), while also being outclassed by 4 or 5 better Steel-types.\
If you want a big Bug-type, this is it. Though its runner-up is just barely below it, and much easier to catch. Keep scrolling.

### Pinsir - Vicegrip (but don't use that)
![Pinsir](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/pinsir.png)

> Bug Bite + X-Scissor
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Pinsir is generally uncommon in the wild, and has been Jessie's catchable Shadow Pokemon for a while now, making it quite easy to get your hands on (especially as purifying the Shadow will get you a Lv25 easily). As Genesect is only slightly better offensively, most players will do just fine relying on Pinsir, or to a slightly lesser degree any of the budget Bug-types I've written about in [The Budget Dream Team](/go/teambuilding/budget-dream-team).

## Fairy-Type

The things of storybooks and fables, **Fairy-type** Pokemon have a unique mystique to them, that unfortunately doesn't translate well into battle. Though they do counter **Dragon-types** better than anything else, with a 2x Resistance to the beasts, that's the part they were built for: Defense. **Fairies** will take a beating and keep standing, but at the cost of having very poor offense to work with. As I said at the very start of this article, we want fast power in high DPS, even if it means fainting more. Surviving until the end doesn't help us if the timer runs out before the Raid Boss faints.

### Gardevoir - Pretty, I guess.
![Gardevoir](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/gardevoir.png)

> Charm + Dazzling Gleam
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Gardevoir is one of Kirlia's evolutions (base-form being Ralts), along with Gallade (which has no place here). This already means it's going to take a good while to collect enough candy to get evolved, being 125 from a rare wild spawn. Once you get there though, you have the second worst Type leader (only ahead of Genesect representing Bug-type). Gardevoir boasts solid Defense, and very lackluster Attack, making it horrible for attacking Raids. This is as good as Fairy-type gets though, so if you really want a hard-hitting Fairy, this is the closest you'll find.

### Togekiss - Eggbird
![Togekiss](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/togekiss.png)

> Charm + Dazzling Gleam
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Togekiss is the final stage of Togepi. Meaning you either have to hatch a Togepi (only ocassionally in Eggs) and give it 125 candy, or capture Togetic from 3✰ Raids when it's around and use 100 candy. It's a hard to get Pokemon, either way, and in the end it's not worth Raiding with. It has use in [Go Battle League](/go/pvp/), but that's not what we're talking about here.

### Granbull - Mad Dog
![Granbull](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/granbull.png)

> Charm + Play Rough
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The only Fairy-type up here that can be found with any sort of ease. Snubbull around in the wild every now and then, and only takes 50 candy to evolve into Granbull. Granbull isn't even very far behind Togekiss or even Gardevoir in terms of attacking Raid Bosses, so it's much more worth your time and effort to just worry about grabbing a few of these if you really want Fairy-types for a Raid Party, for some reason. I should remind you though, there are better types out there.


## Flying-Type

Simply said, **Fire** and **Psychic-types** hit harder than **Flying-type** Pokemon tend to, and are less fragile. There are very few Raid Bosses that would be better countered by these birds, and only a single Legendary. (Virizion)

### Moltres - Sky Attack or Bust
![Moltres](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/moltres.png)

> Wing Attack + Sky Attack†
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The Elite Charge Move **Sky Attack†** pushes Moltres into the top slot when it comes to Flying-type attackers. It commonly has this Elite Move when caught from 5✰ Raids these days, but it's not a guarantee. Make sure to check the event details to find out if **Sky Attack†** is a part of the deal or not.\
Though with all of that said, Moltres is better off with a non-Elite [**Double-Fire Moveset**](#moltres---rising-phoenix).

### Honchkrow - Darkness is behind me.
![Honchkrow](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/honchkrow.png)

> Peck + Sky Attack
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Evolving from Murkrow with 100 Candy and a Sinnoh stone, Honchkrow is one of the best [Dark-type attackers](#weavile--honchkrow---dark-sinnoh-evolutions) in the game. It's also great as a Flying-type attacker, but with how useful Dark-types are against many 5✰ Raid Bosses (including Mewtwo), you'd be silly to bother giving it a **Double-Flying Moveset**.

### Zapdos & Rayquaza - Quell the Storm
![Zapdos](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/zapdos.png)![Rayquaza](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/rayquaza.png)

> Thunder Shock†/Charge Beam + Drill Peck
{:.note title="Zapdos' Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Air Slash + Aerial Ace
{:.note title="Rayquaza's Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Zapdos (with or without its Elite Fast Move) and Rayquaza (on any day) are two more Legendary Pokemon that are good at using Flying-type moves, but better off specializing in their other Types. Zapdos should be an [Electric-type attacker](#zapdos---pure-instinct), and Rayquaza is the best [Dragon-type attacker](#rayquaza---king-of-dragons) there is, and likely ever will be.


## Poison-Type

With one of **Poison's** main targets being **Grass**, which often has **Poison** as its secondary Type, these toxic monsters are off to a bad start. Beyond the two Pokemon listed here, **Poison-types** have comparable stats to the lowly **Bugs** we covered higher up. The one thing they might be good for is breaking through **Fairy-type** Pokemon's high Defense, but **Steel-types** are still better suited for the job.

### Gengar - Ghosts and Ghosts and Ghosts
![Gengar](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/gengar.png)

> Shadow Claw + Sludge Bomb
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

[As discussed in the Ghost-type section](#gengar---now-you-see-me-now-you-dont), Gengar hits very hard and gets hit very hard in return. This holds true as a Poison-type attacker, boasting only slightly lower DPS (1% less than a **Double-Ghost Moveset**). If you have a good Gengar, you should already know to give it Ghost-type moves, but if you have a full team of Pokemon better than it (minus keeping one to Mega Evolve), then maybe you can give it new life with **Sludge Bomb**, however rarely it may be used.

### Roserade - Why so Toxic?
![Roserade](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/roserade.png)

> Poison Jab + Sludge Bomb
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The only **Double-Poison Moveset** worth talking about here. There are several in [The Budget Dream Team](budget-dream-team.md) but none that hit hard enough to warrant a slot on this page. Once again, it's a Pokemon we've already covered, this time in the [Grass-type section](#roserade---beauty-and-thorns), Roserade. The same goes here as it does for Gengar. You should already be using Roserade as a Grass-type attacker (especially as it's #1), but if you have tons or just love Poison-type, then sure, do this I guess.


## Normal-Type

The most unfortunate Type when it comes to attacking, the **Normal-type** isn't Super-Effective against any Type at all. Though they can often learn a wide variety of Typed moves, they won't get STAB on any of them, making them 25% weaker all the time when compared to properly Typed counters.\
Though I'm personally a fan of many **Normal-type** Pokemon, I'll be discussing none here, because they won't do you any good at all in Raid Battles.
