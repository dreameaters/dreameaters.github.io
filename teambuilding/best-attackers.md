# Best Attackers to Train

This article serves to give an analysis and breakdown of the various top performing Pokemon in terms of battling Raid Bosses. The main aspect important in an attacker is high DPS (Damage Per Second), meaning that bulkier Pokemon with high Defense or HP won't be as useful. Pokemon with simply high Attack, and powerful moves, will prevail here. Also, it's a high priority for attackers to exclusively use moves matching one of their Types, like a Fire-type Pokemon using a Fire-type move, as it would gain STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), making the move 25% more powerful. Finally, having a moveset where both moves are the same Type is commonly called a "Double-[type]" moveset, and is almost always ideal.

> Charizard, a Fire/Flying-type Pokemon, with the Fast Move of **Fire Spin** and the Charge Move of **Blast Burn** would be considered to have a **Double-Fire Moveset**, allowing it to constantly deal Super-Effective damage on a Bug, Grass, or Ice-type opponent, and would deal 25% more damage due to STAB with both moves.

# Major Types

These are the Types that you'll get the most use out of, simply due to the fact that lots of 5⭐ and Mega Raid Bosses are weak to them. You'll no doubt want a full Party of six for each of these Types, eventually hosting the most powerful of each category.

## Dark-Type

**Dark-type** Pokemon will be your best friends against **Psychic-types** like Mewtwo, Latios, Lugia, Cresselia, and more. Dealing Super-Effective damage while also boasting a 2x Resistance to Psychic-type moves, Dark-type Pokemon will hit hard, and survive very well at the same time.\
They'll also help you deal with **Ghost-types** well enough, hitting for weakness again, while taking neutral damage in return.

### Darkrai - Shadow of Nightmares
![Darkrai](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/darkrai.png)

> Snarl + Dark Pulse
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Darkrai is the best Dark-type in the game, and will likely keep that title forever. It's found only in 5⭐ Raids, and is classified as a Mythical Pokemon, meaning that it's unable to be traded. Pummeling it with a lobby of other Trainers, all using their best Fighting-types, is gonna be your only means of catching it. But it will be well worth it, as it's one of the most valuable Raid Bosses in the game, and serves as both the top Dark-type attacker as well as the top Ghost-type attacker, despite not being Ghost-type itself. More info on that [here.](#darkrai---thats-no-ghost){:.heading.flip-title}

### Weavile & Honchkrow - Dark Sinnoh Evolutions
![Weavile](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/weavile.png)![Honchkrow](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/honchkrow.png)

> Snarl + Foul Play
{:.note title="Weavile Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Snarl + Sky Attack
{:.note title="Honchkrow Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Weavile and Honchkrow perform very similarly when Honchkrow uses **Dark Pulse** instead of **Sky Attack**, so I'm covering them together. When Honchkrow uses the optimal **Sky Attack** rather than going with a **Double-Dark Moveset** to match Weavile, it's much like Darkrai instead.\
Weavile evolves from Sneasel, and Honchkrow from Murkrow. Both require 100 Candy and a Sinnoh Stone to evolve. These Pokemon are both regularly uncommon, with Sneasel showing up more easily during Snowy weather. It will take some time, but should be a pretty consistent grind to get either of these two, and they're always worth catching. (Though Murkrow has a pretty annoying catch rate. Razz Berries recommended.)

> Noting that Honchkrow uses **Sky Attack** as its Charge Move, it can learn **Dark Pulse** instead at the cost of 16.7% DPS (damage per second) in exchange for a **Double-Dark Moveset**. This makes it on par with Weavile, rather than Darkrai.
{:.note title="Note: Double-Dark Honchkrow"}

### Hydreigon - Tyrant Dragon
![Hydreigon](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/hydreigon.png)

> Bite + Dark Pulse
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Hydreigon is a powerful Dark-type attacker, if you can manage to get one. The base-stage, Deino, is only available from Go Battle League reward encounters, and 12km red eggs (at the time of writing this). So it's bound to be a big grind, a lot of walking, or a large Rare Candy investment to get it fully evolved up with 125 Candy. But if you get one, it's one of the most solid Dark-types in the game. With respectable bulk and *plenty* of power, Hydreigon is sure to serve you well if you can get your hands on it.

### Houndoom - Hell Hound
![Houndoom](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/houndoom.png)

> Snarl + Foul Play
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Houndoom can be easy to get if you find many Fire-types in the wild near you, or if its Mega Evolution is currently in Raids. Houndour can also be rescued from Team Go Rocket Grunts. However you get it, Houndoom is a great Dark-type to have, especially early on, and the potential to Mega Evolve it is a great bonus.

### Tyranitar - The Old King
![Tyranitar](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/tyranitar.png)

> Bite + Crunch
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The greatest Dark-type attacker back in the day, Tyranitar is still a force to be reckoned with today. If you have some from back in its glory days, they're as good as they every were, it's just that now some newer Pokemon have surpassed them. If you don't have any yet, they're still a great Pokemon to train up. Catch it when it comes to 3✰ Raids, evolve a Shadow/Purified Larvitar, or stock up on wild catches when they're part of an event. With a Mega Evolution releasing later on, Tyranitar is sure to be sticking around.

> Shadow Tyranitar is an absolute beast, and though I'm not detailing Shadow Pokemon in this article, check out [Shadow Pokemon](/go/teambuilding/shadow-pokemon/) if you want to learn more. (Recommended Lv35+)
{:.note title="To purify or not..."}


## Dragon-Type

Super-effective against their own kind, **Dragon-types** are a bit of a double-edged sword, but they also happen to be some of the strongest Pokemon in existence. Though they faint quickly to each other, they're also the quickest at taking each other down. You're bound to amass a great collection of powerful Dragons eventually, and until then, **Ice-types** will help you wear them down to capture for yourself.

### Rayquaza - King of Dragons
![Rayquaza](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/rayquaza.png)

> Dragon Tail + Outrage
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Rayquaza is the strongest Dragon-type there is. With a Mega Evolution coming at some point, it's only going to get stronger. The best part of this is that two Trainers with Lv25 Mamoswine, Galarian Darmanitan, Glaceon, and/or Weavile can defeat it. If it's Snowing, it's easy. If the Pokemon are above Lv25, also easy. For one of the most powerful Pokemon in the game, and the best Dragon-type all around, Rayquaza is incredibly easy to get. It's just a matter of waiting for it to show up in 5⭐ Raids.

### Dialga - Shielded Dragon
![Dialga](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/dialga.png)

> Dragon Breath + Draco Meteor
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Due to the secondary Steel-typing, Dialga is the only Dragon-type Pokemon to *not* be weak to Dragon itself. That incredible fact combined with great DPS, makes it an extremely important Pokemon to have. Unfortunately, it's only been in 5⭐ Raids very few times since it was first released in early 2019. Everyone is eagerly awaiting this truly Legendary Dragon's return. Be sure to catch as many as you can once it's available again.

### Salamence & Dragonite - Rayquaza's Grunts
![Salamence](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/salamence.png)![Dragonite](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/dragonite.png)

> Dragon Tail + Outrage*
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Dragon Tail + Draco Meteor*
{:.note title="B-Tier Moveset"}
{:.faded}

These two are very similar, sharing the Dragon/Flying-typing as well as having the exact same best, and second best, movesets. They also share their types and moves with the great Rayquaza. Salamence has a little more Attack and a little less Defense, while Dragonite is the opposite. We know that offense is preferred, so generally Salamence is the better option, but they're both so close that it doesn't make much of a difference. Speaking of not much difference, their B-Tier Moveset is nearly as good as their Optimal Moveset (~2.5% DPS difference).\
Additionally, Salamence will get a Mega Evolution at some point in the future, while Dragonite will not.

> *Dragonite has **Outrage** as a normal move, learnable by regular Charge TM, while **Draco Meteor** is an Elite Move learnable only during certain events or via Elite Charge TM. The opposite is true for Salamence.
> {:.note title="Important! Elite Moves"}

### Haxorus & Garchomp - Dragons of Myth
![Haxorus](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/haxorus.png)![Garchomp](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/garchomp.png)

> Dragon Tail + Dragon Claw
{:.note title="Haxorus' Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Dragon Tail + Outrage
{:.note title="Garchomp's Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Description coming soon.

### Palkia - Pearlescent Dragon
![Palkia](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/palkia.png)

> Dragon Tail + Draco Meteor
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Description coming soon.

### Zekrom & Reshiram - Far From Home
![Zekrom](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/zekrom.png)![Reshiram](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/reshiram.png)

> Dragon Breath + Outrage
{:.note title="Zekrom's Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Dragon Breath + Draco Meteor
{:.note title="Reshiram's Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Both strong Dragons, but extremely top their other types, Electric and Fire respectively.\
Description coming soon.


## Rock-Type

Rock and roll! **Rock-type** Pokemon lead the pack in defeating both **Flying-type** and **Fire-type** Pokemon. If you're lacking in other types, they can also take down most **Ice-types** well enough. Plus, if you have any **Bug-types** to squish, rather than burn, then **Rock-type** Pokemon will server you well.

### Rampardos - Extinct for a reason.
![Rampardos](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/rampardos.png)

> Smack Down + Rock Slide
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

### Rhyperior - Arm Cannons
![Rhyperior](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/rhyperior.png)

> Smack Down + Rock Wrecker†
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

### Terrakion - The Sword of Justice
![Terrakion](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/terrakion.png)

> Smack Down + Rock Slide
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

### Tyranitar - Godzilla of Old
![Tyranitar](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/tyranitar.png)

> Smack Down† + Stone Edge
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Bite + Stone Edge
{:.note title="B-Tier Moveset"}
{:.faded}

**Bite** gives the same DPS as **Smack Down†**, but it's Dark-type instead of Rock-type. Tyranitar will still get STAB on it, but if your opponent isn't weak to Dark-type, you're losing out on Super-Effective damage.

## Fire-Type

The searing flames of **Fire-type** Pokemon should be your first pick for dealing with **Grass**, **Ice**, or **Steel-type** Pokemon. With *many* powerful Pokemon in this Type, every Trainer is sure to have a good roster of **Fire-types** ready to blaze through the competition.

### Reshiram - Lord of Fire
![Reshiram](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/reshiram.png)

> Fire Fang + Overheat
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

### Darmanitan - Gurilla Tactics
![Darmanitan](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/darmanitan-standard.png)

> Fire Fang + Overheat
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

### Chandelure - Will-o-Wisp
![Chandelure](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/chandelure.png)

> Fire Spin + Overheat
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

### Blaziken - From Good to Great!
![Blaziken](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/blaziken.png)

> Counter + Blast Burn†
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Counter + Blaze Kick
{:.note title="Vanilla Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Using **Fire Spin** instead of **Counter** For Blaziken's Fast Move gives you a **Double-Fire Moveset**, while only sacrificing 2.5% damage. If the Raid Boss you're battling isn't weak to Fighting, it's a worthwhile swap, even if it means simply toggling it with a Fast TM.

### Moltres - Rising Phoenix!
![Moltres](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/moltres.png)

> Fire Spin + Overheat
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

### Charizard & Infernape - Blast Burn!!
![Charizard](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/charizard.png)![Infernape](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/infernape.png)

> Fire Spin + Blast Burn†
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Charizard and Infernape have the same moveset.\
Description coming soon.

### Entei & Heatran - Volcanic Legends!
![Entei](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/entei.png)![Heatran](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/heatran.png)

> Fire Fang + Overheat
{:.note title="Entei Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Fire Spin + Flamethrower
{:.note title="Heatran Moveset"}
{:.faded}

### Flareon - Hot Dog
![Flareon](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/flareon.png)

> Fire Spin + Overheat/Flamethrower
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

**Overheat** is less than 1% DPS stronger than **Flamethrower**, so either is perfectly fine. Just be sure to replace **Fire Blast** if you have it, as it's far worse than the other two. (Also the Elite Move **Last Resort**, if evolved during a special event. It's only used in Go Battle League.)

## Fighting-Type

The big bruisers of the Pokemon world! **Fighting-type** Pokemon live up to their name, boasting incredible Attack power. There's no better choice for breaking apart **Rock-types**, and are *required* for facing off against **Dark-types**. Also, if you ever need to, they're the only Type that's Super-Effective against **Normal-type** Pokemon.

### Lucario - The Aura Warrior
![Lucario](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/lucario.png)

> Counter + Aura Sphere
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

### Conkeldurr - Bigger Machamp
![Conkeldurr](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/conkeldurr.png)

> Counter + Dynamic Punch
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

### Machamp - The OG MVP
![Machamp](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/machamp.png)

> Counter + Dynamic Punch
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Counter + Close Combat
{:.note title="B-Tier Moveset"}
{:.faded}

**Close Combat** does soften Machamp's impact noticeably, but as Machamp has 5 different Charge Moves, you could easily burn several Charge TMs trying to swap to **Dynamic Punch**. So if you're short on Charge TMs, sticking with **Close Combat** can be good enough until you have some extras to gamble with, but know that **Dynamic Punch** is definitely worth the upgrade.

### Breloom & Hariyama - Two Halves of Machamp
![Breloom](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/breloom.png)![Hariyama](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/hariyama.png)

> Counter + Dynamic Punch
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}


## Psychic-Type

Proudly including the most powerful Pokemon of all time, Mewtwo, the **Psychic-type** has been considered extremely powerful since Pokemon first began. It still holds up well to that acclaim now, tearing through **Fighting-type** Pokemon, and **Poison-types**. Even in neutral matchups, Mewtwo itself can be a reliable party member.

### Mewtwo - The Most Powerful Pokemon
![Mewtwo](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/mewtwo.png)

> Confusion + Psystrike
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}

### Latios - Big Bro
![Latios](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/latios.png)

{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}

Simply more offensive than its red sister, Latias.

### Metagross - Super Computer
![Metagross](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/metagross.png)

> Zen Headbutt + Psychic
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}


## Ice-Type

When you have no Dragons, you'll want plenty of **Ice-types**. Freezing **Dragon-type** Pokemon out of the sky, especially the ones that are also **Flying-type** (I'm looking at you, Rayquaza), these chill Pokemon will have a great place in your Raid Parties. Not to mention their use against **Ground-types**, and **Fire-types** if you lack their other counters.

### Darmanitan (Galarian) - Insert Snowman Joke

## Electric-Type

Having only a single weakness in **Ground-types**, **Electric-type** Pokemon can be intimidating to battle against. Hitting Super-Effective damage against **Flying** and **Water-type** Pokemon means there are very common Pokemon that these shocking monsters can paralyze.

### Zekrom - Lord of Thunder

## Ghost-Type

Much like Dragons, **Ghost-type** Pokemon are weak and strong against each other. Though **Dark-types** have nothing to fear from these ghouls, **Ghost-types** will hit even harder than the dark foes. It's a real risk for reward, and when Raiding, fainting faster is always worth it to KO the Raid Boss fast as well.

### Darkrai - That's no ghost!

## Ground-Type

As the *only* counter to **Electric-types**, **Ground-type** Pokemon are absolutely required in any Trainer's box. Dealing well with **Steel** and **Fire-types** means that these earthly beasts will have many chances to prove their worth to you.

### Landorus (Therian Forme) - The old ones warned about this...

> Mud-Slap + Earthquake
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset for both"}
{:.faded}

Taking only 25 Candy to evolve from Rhyhorn, Rhydon is very accessible, and is a great choice for how powerful it is. Though it could be considered a budget Ground-type to deal with Electric-types early on, it packs enough of a punch to be considered good for a long while after you've gotten more of a collection, before eventually evolving it.\
As it takes 100 Candy to evolve Rhydon to Rhyperior (plus a Sinnoh Stone), you would be best off just using that candy to get more Rhydon first if you're on a budget. You can always evolve your Rhydon army into a Rhyperior army later on, but having multiple Rhydon will be more useful to fill out a starting Ground-type Party than a single Rhyperior. Just remember that of course the evolution is always an upgrade, so long as you already have 6 Pokemon to fill your Party.

## Steel-Type

Nothing fares better against **Ice-types** than **Steel-type** Pokemon. Should any **Fairy-type** Pokemon give you trouble, with their high Defense, then **Steel-types** are sure to cut them down to size, like a hero's sword.

### Metagross - Meteor Mash or Bust!

# B-Tier Types

These couple of Types both counter two of the same Types, and one unique Type each. In addition covering for eachother, which they both do so equally well, they both have three Types from the group above that simply do their jobs better most of the time. So, while these two Types are certainly nothing to stick your nose up to, you may eventually find yourself using them less often as you collect more powerful options.\
Listen to me though, this doesn't mean you should ignore them. They're largely accessible, and easier to train up than the Types we've covered already. They could be the quick start you've been looking for.

## Grass-Type

Outclassed by **Electric**, **Ice**, and **Fighting**, **Grass-type** Pokemon are built to counter **Water**, **Ground**, and **Rock-types**. They still work very well, but there's normally a better counter out there, if you can get one.

### Roserade - Beauty and Thorns!

## Water-Type

Outclassed by **Ice**, **Ground**, and **Rock-types**, **Water-type** Pokemon can still hold their own and take down **Fire**, **Ground**, and **Rock-type** Pokemon.
Though **Water** and **Grass-types** share a couple purposes, they are on par with each other and will do their jobs well when needed.

Crawdaunt can swap use **Waterfall** instead of **Snarl** for it's Fast Move in order to have a **Double-Water Moveset**, sacrificing 7.8% DPS.

Using **Aqua Tail†** (Gyarados' Community Day Elite Move) instead of **Hydro Pump** for Gyarados' Fast Move barely loses any damage (1.4% DPS), so if you have that already, don't waste the Charge TM to swap to **Hydro Pump**.

# Outclassed

The Types listed here are almost never useful for Raiding, either due to terrible Attack stats, bad moves, or simply existing in the shadow of another Type that counters its targets better. Trainers generally ignore these Types when building Raid Parties, but as everyone has their favorite Types and may want to know how they can get the most out of them, I'm including them in this article mostly for the sake of completion. Be warned though that I will be ripping into them pretty hard, as I have almost nothing good to say about their capabilities as attackers. Several of them have better uses in [Go Battle League](/go/pvp/), but you'll have to read about that on another section of the site.

## Bug-Type

The **Bug-type** was simply never meant to be a big deal, as sad as that is to say plainly. They can counter big Types like **Dark** and **Psychic**, as well as **Grass**, but we've already discussed ways to deal with those, and **Bug-types** have *much* lower stats to work with. Fainting faster, and not hitting very hard, it's tough to find any reason to use them in Raids.

### Genesect - Metabee?
![Genesect](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/genesect.png)

> Fury Cutter + X-Scissor
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Genesect is as good as Bug-types get. Hosting the lowest DPS of any Type's #1 slot, Genesect also holds the "honor" of being a Mythical Pokemon, locked behind a Special Research, 5⭐ Raids, and being unable to be traded. So not only is the best Bug-type the worst #1, but it's also about as complicated as it gets to obtain. To top it all off, Genesect performs a bit better as a [Steel-type attacker](#genesect---death-metal-bug), while also being outclassed by 4 or 5 better Steel-types.\
If you want a big Bug-type, this is it. Though its runner-up is just barely below it, and much easier to catch. Keep scrolling.

### Pinsir - Vicegrip (but don't use that)
![Pinsir](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/pinsir.png)

> Bug Bite + X-Scissor
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Pinsir is generally uncommon in the wild, and has been Jessie's catchable Shadow Pokemon for a while now, making it quite easy to get your hands on (especially as purifying the Shadow will get you a Lv25 easily). As Genesect is only slightly better offensively, most players will do just fine relying on Pinsir, or to a slightly lesser degree any of the budget Bug-types I've written about in [The Budget Dream Team.](/go/teambuilding/budget-dream-team){:.heading.flip-title}
{:.read-more}

## Fairy-Type

The things of storybooks and fables, **Fairy-type** Pokemon have a unique mystique to them, that unfortunately doesn't translate well into battle. Though they do counter **Dragon-types** better than anything else, with a 2x Resistance to the beasts, that's the part they were built for: Defense. **Fairies** will take a beating and keep standing, but at the cost of having very poor offense to work with. As I said at the very start of this article, we want fast power in high DPS, even if it means fainting more. Surviving until the end doesn't help us if the timer runs out before the Raid Boss faints.

### Gardevoir - Pretty, I guess.
![Gardevoir](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/gardevoir.png)

> Charm + Dazzling Gleam
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Gardevoir is one of Kirlia's evolutions (base-form being Ralts), along with Gallade (which has no place here). This already means it's going to take a good while to collect enough candy to get evolved, being 125 from a rare wild spawn. Once you get there though, you have the second worst Type leader (only ahead of Genesect representing Bug-type). Gardevoir boasts solid Defense, and very lackluster Attack, making it horrible for attacking Raids. This is as good as Fairy-type gets though, so if you really want a hard-hitting Fairy, this is the closest you'll find.

### Togekiss - Eggbird
![Togekiss](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/togekiss.png)

> Charm + Dazzling Gleam
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Togekiss is the final stage of Togepi. Meaning you either have to hatch a Togepi (only ocassionally in Eggs) and give it 125 candy, or capture Togetic from 3⭐ Raids when it's around and use 100 candy. It's a hard to get Pokemon, either way, and in the end it's not worth Raiding with. It has use in [Go Battle League](/go/pvp/), but that's not what we're talking about here.

### Granbull - Mad Dog
![Granbull](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/granbull.png)

> Charm + Play Rough
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The only Fairy-type up here that can be found with any sort of ease. Snubbull around in the wild every now and then, and only takes 50 candy to evolve into Granbull. Granbull isn't even very far behind Togekiss or even Gardevoir in terms of attacking Raid Bosses, so it's much more worth your time and effort to just worry about grabbing a few of these if you really want Fairy-types for a Raid Party, for some reason. I should remind you though, there are better types out there.

## Flying-Type

Simply said, **Fire** and **Psychic-types** hit harder than **Flying-type** Pokemon tend to, and are less fragile. There are very few Raid Bosses that would be better countered by these birds, and only a single Legendary. (Virizion)

## Poison-Type

With one of **Poison's** main targets being **Grass**, which often has **Poison** as its secondary Type, these toxic monsters are off to a bad start. Beyond the two Pokemon listed here, **Poison-types** have comparable stats to the lowly **Bugs** we covered higher up. The one thing they might be good for is breaking through **Fairy-type** Pokemon's high Defense, but **Steel-types** are still better suited for the job.

### Gengar - Ghosts and Ghosts and Ghosts
![Gengar](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/gengar.png)

> Shadow Claw + Sludge Bomb
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

[As discussed in the Ghost-type section](#gengar---now-you-see-me-now-you-dont), Gengar hits very hard and gets hit very hard in return. This holds true as a Poison-type attacker, boasting only slightly lower DPS (1% less than a **Double-Ghost Moveset**). If you have a good Gengar, you should already know to give it Ghost-type moves, but if you have a full team of Pokemon better than it (minus keeping one to Mega Evolve), then maybe you can give it new life with **Sludge Bomb**, however rarely it may be used.

### Roserade - Why so Toxic?
![Roserade](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/roserade.png)

> Poison Jab + Sludge Bomb
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

The only **Double-Poison Moveset** worth talking about here. There are several in [The Budget Dream Team](budget-dream-team.md) but none that hit hard enough to warrant a slot on this page. Once again, it's a Pokemon we've already covered, this time in the [Grass-type section](#roserade---beauty-and-thorns), Roserade. The same goes here as it does for Gengar. You should already be using Roserade as a Grass-type attacker (especially as it's #1), but if you have tons or just love Poison-type, then sure, do this I guess.


## Normal-Type

The most unfortunate Type when it comes to attacking, the **Normal-type** isn't Super-Effective against any Type at all. Though they can often learn a wide variety of Typed moves, they won't get STAB on any of them, making them 25% weaker all the time when compared to properly Typed counters.\
Though I'm personally a fan of many **Normal-type** Pokemon, I'll be discussing none here, because they won't do you any good at all in Raid Battles.
