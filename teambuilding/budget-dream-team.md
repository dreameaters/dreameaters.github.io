# The Budget Dream Team

If you don't have many Pokemon of a certain Type, and the ones listed in my [Best Attackers](/go/teambuilding/best-attackers) guide are out of your reach, then this is the place to be to fill in those gaps.\
The Pokemon listed here are easy to get, first and foremost. They mostly won't be as good as the **Best Attackers** of course, but some of them come close, and the goal is just to get you a Party that will work well enough for now. You can eventually rotate some of these Pokemon out of your Raid Parties as you start to collect better ones. These will do alright for your until then, to make sure you don't get crushed in a Raid, and make you feel confident instead of being unsure why your team isn't doing as well as some other Trainers in your lobby.
