# Building a Good Pokemon

Not all Pokemon are created equal, but it's important to know how to get the best out of the Pokemon that you have. Between different moves to learn, levels and powering-up, typings, Luckies, Elite and Legacy moves, and whatever Appraisal and IVs mean, there's a lot that goes into figuring out which of your Pokemon are the best, and a lot to know if you wanna bring out their full potential.\
This guide aims to give you all the information you'll need to make smart and strategic decisions to build strong Pokemon, without wasting your important resources like Stardust, TMs and Rare Candy.
