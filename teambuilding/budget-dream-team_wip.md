# The Budget Dream Team

If you don't have many Pokemon of a certain Type, and the ones listed in my [Best Attackers](/go/teambuilding/best-attackers) guide are out of your reach, then this is the place to be to fill in those gaps.\
The Pokemon listed here are easy to get, first and foremost, which means that super rare wild encounters, Legendaries, Shadow Pokemon, and Mega Evolutions will be excluded. They mostly won't be as good as the Best Attackers of course, but some of them come close, and the goal is just to get you a Party that will work well enough for now. You can eventually rotate some of these Pokemon out of your Raid Parties as you start to collect better ones. These will do alright for you until then, to make sure you don't get crushed in a Raid, and make you feel confident alongside your fellow Trainers in a lobby.

> Some Pokemon listed in this guide are also listed in the Best Attackers guide. This means, in addition to being easy to get, they're also fantastic enough to be considered a top choice. Any Best Attackers in this list will be denoted by a ✰ next to their name.

The main aspect important in an attacker is high DPS (Damage Per Second), meaning that bulkier Pokemon with high Defense or HP won't be as useful. Pokemon with simply high Attack, and powerful moves, will prevail here. Also, it's a high priority for attackers to exclusively use moves matching one of their Types, like a Fire-type Pokemon using a Fire-type move, as it would gain STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), making the move 25% more powerful. Finally, having a moveset where both moves are the same Type is commonly called a "Double-[type]" moveset, and is almost always ideal.

> Charizard, a Fire/Flying-type Pokemon, with the Fast Move of **Fire Spin** and the Charge Move of **Blast Burn** would be considered to have a **Double-Fire Moveset**, allowing it to constantly deal Super-Effective damage on a Bug, Grass, or Ice-type opponent, and would deal 25% more damage due to STAB with both moves.
{:.note title="Example of an Ideal Attacker"}

With all of that said, if you still find yourself struggling to build a Party after reviewing this guide, then your best bet is to simply use your highest CP Pokemon of the Type you need, as long as they have a Double-[type] moveset.\
Further advice and guidance on building a team from whatever you have can be found in [Building a Good Pokemon](/go/building-a-good-pokemon/).

## Psychic Starter - Walking with Eevee

A boutique Jekyll theme for hackers, nerds, and academics.  

### Espeon - Starting out strong!

Espeon is the #1 vanilla Psychic-type, and will be good forever.

### Alakazam - Trading makes things easier.

> Psycho Cut + Future Sight
{:.note title="B-Tier Moveset"}
{:.faded}

Glass-cannon, but very easy to get if you have friends to trade with.

Alakazam has Psychic as an *Elite* Charge Move. That means it can only learn it via an Elite Charge TM. It's better than Future Sight, but please don't use your Elite Charge TM on it. There are **much** better uses for it once you have rarer and more powerful Pokemon. It would be a huge waste.

### Exeggutor - Can't make a Raid party without breaking a few eggs.

![Exeggcute](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/exeggcute.png)![Exeggutor](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/home/normal/exeggutor.png)

> Confusion + Psychic
{:.note title="Optimal Moveset"}
{:.faded}

> Extrasensory + Psychic
{:.note title="B-Tier Moveset"}
{:.faded}

That's probably the longest tagline on the site, but don't let the bad joke fool you. Exeggutor is a very strong Psychic-type to start out with, if you're left with no easier choices. Unfortunately, Exeggcute isn't always easy to come by, but if the season's right and Grass-type Pokemon are common in your area, then it's definitely worth catching some during Clear weather (which is *far* more common than the Psychic-boosting Windy weather) and evolving your Lv30+ ones to quickly build a solid team of **Confusion + Psychic** attacking palm trees.


## Fighting Back! - Mind Over Matter

## Dark as Night - Fight evil, then harness it!

All of the Dark-type Pokemon listed below are in 3✰ Raids quite often, and have Mega Evolutions (only Houndoom is released so far). This should make any of the three relatively accessible, as well as making it easy to grind Mega Energy for them at the same time (which would make them even better for future Raids).

### Tyranitar

### Houndoom

### Absol


## Mewtwo and Friends - ???

### Mewtwo

### Darkrai

### Giratina (Origin Forme)
