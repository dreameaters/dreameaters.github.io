# Building a Good Pokemon

Not all Pokemon are created equal, but it's important to know how to get the best out of the Pokemon that you have.

## Psychic Starter - Walking with Eevee

A boutique Jekyll theme for hackers, nerds, and academics.  

### Espeon - Starting out strong!

> Confusion + Future Sight

Espeon is the #1 vanilla Psychic-type, and will be good forever.

### Alakazam - Trading makes things easier.

> Psycho Cut/Confusion + Future Sight

Glass-cannon, but very easy to get if you have friends to trade with.

### Exeggutor - Can't make a Raid party without breaking a few eggs.

> Confusion + Psychic
{:.figcaption}

That's probably the longest tagline on the site, but don't let the bad joke fool you. Exeggutor is a very strong Psychic-type to start out with, if you're left with no easier choices. Unfortunately, Exeggcute isn't always easy to come by, but if the season's right and Grass-type Pokemon are common in your area, then it's definitely worth catching some during Clear weather (which is *far* more common than the Psychic-boosting Windy weather) and evolving your Lv30+ ones to quickly build a solid team of **Confusion + Psychic** attacking palm trees.


## Level - Time to Power-Up?

**Hydejack** is 100% built on Open Source software, and is Open Source itself, save for parts of the PRO version. The PRO version is a one-time payment that gives you the right to use it forever.

### Default Levels

**Wild Pokemon** spawning normally on the map can be anywhere from **Lv1** up to whatever Trainer Level you are (or **Lv30**, if you're above Trainer Level 30).\
If the current weather boosts the type of Pokemon that spawned, it will always be **5** levels higher than it would have been, even if that makes it higher than your Trainer Level (or past the Lv30 cap).

This means that the highest level wild Pokemon can spawn at is **Lv35**, when weather boosted, and Lv30 otherwise.

> Weather boosts 2-3 types of Pokemon. Their spawned level increases by 5, and their IVs are at least 4.

**Raid Bosses** will be caught at **Lv20**, unless weather-boosted, in which case they gain the **+5** levels, as usual, making them **Lv25**. Catching weather-boosted Legendaries will save you a lot of hard to get Legendary Pokemon candy, and/or Rare Candy. Though keep in mind that the Raid Boss will be **5** levels higher in the Raid Battle as well, making it harder to defeat.

**Shadow Pokemon** will be caught at **Lv8**, unless weather-boosted, in which case they gain the usual **+5** levels, making them **Lv13**. As Shadow Pokemon cost more Stardust to Power-Up than regular Pokemon, catching them weather-boosted can save you a decent chunk of Stardust. Though, this is a lot harder to control than Raid Bosses or wild Pokemon, since Go Rocket battles spawn at specific times in balloons, or at PokeStops, leaving you to battle them on their schedule, not being able to plan around the weather very easily.

**Research Rewards** (Field, Special, Timed, or Breakthrough) will be **Lv15**, regardless of weather.
