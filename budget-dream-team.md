# Building a Good Pokemon

Not all Pokemon are created equal, but it's important to know how to get the best out of the Pokemon that you have.

## Psychic Starter - Walking with Eevee

A boutique Jekyll theme for hackers, nerds, and academics.  

### Espeon - Starting out strong!

Espeon is the #1 vanilla Psychic-type, and will be good forever.

### Alakazam - Trading makes things easier.

> Psycho Cut/Confusion + Future Sight

Glass-cannon, but very easy to get if you have friends to trade with.

### Exeggutor - Can't make a Raid party without breaking a few eggs.

> Confusion + Psychic

That's probably the longest tagline on the site, but don't let the bad joke fool you. Exeggutor is a very strong Psychic-type to start out with, if you're left with no easier choices. Unfortunately, Exeggcute isn't always easy to come by, but if the season's right and Grass-type Pokemon are common in your area, then it's definitely worth catching some during Clear weather (which is *far* more common than the Psychic-boosting Windy weather) and evolving your Lv30+ ones to quickly build a solid team of **Confusion + Psychic** attacking palm trees.
